<p class="title">CAPTAIN CHUB</p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>THE STOLEN RUN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“That settles that,” groaned the captain of the
Crimson nine as the long fly settled gracefully
into the hands of the Blue’s left-fielder. The runner
who, at the sound of bat meeting ball, had shot
away from second base, slowed his pace and
dropped his head disconsolately as he left the
path to the plate and turned toward the bench.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows,” said the captain cheerfully.
“We’ve got to hold ’em tight. Not a man
sees first, Tom; don’t lose ’em.”</p>

<p>Pritchett, the Crimson pitcher, nodded silently
as he drew on his glove and walked across to the
box. He didn’t mean to lose them. So far, at
the beginning of the ninth inning, it was anybody’s
game. The score was 3 to 3. Pritchett
had pitched a grand game: had eight strike-outs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to his credit, had given but one base on balls, and
had been hit but three times for a total of four
bases. For five innings, for the scoring on both
sides had been done in the first part of the game,
he had held the Blue well in hand, and he didn’t
mean to lose control of the situation now. The
cheering from the stands occupied by the supporters
of the Crimson team, which had died away
as the unlucky hit to left-fielder had retired
the side, began again, and continued until the
first of the blue-stockinged batsmen stepped to
the plate.</p>

<p>It was the end of the year, the final game
and the deciding one. The stands, which started
far beyond third base and continued around behind
first, were filled with a gaily-hued throng,
every member of which claimed allegiance to
Crimson or Blue. Fully eight thousand persons
were awaiting with fast-beating hearts the outcome
of this last inning. The June sun shone
hotly down, and the little breeze which came
across the green field from the direction of the
glinting river did little to mitigate the intolerable
heat. Score-cards waved in front of red, perspiring
faces, straw hats did like duty, and pocket-handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
were tucked inside wilting collars.</p>

<p>Half-way up the cheering section sat a little
group of freshmen, hot and excited, hoarse and
heroic. At every fresh demand from the cheerleader
they strained their tired lungs to new excesses
of sound. Now, panting and laughing,
they fell against each other in simulated exhaustion.</p>

<p>“I wish a thunder-storm would come along,”
said one of the group, weakly.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked another.</p>

<p>“So they’d call the game and I wouldn’t have
to cheer any more,” he sighed.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you do the way Chick does?”
asked a third. “Chick just opens his mouth and
goes through the motions and doesn’t let out a
single yip.”</p>

<p>“I like that!” exclaimed the maligned one.
“I’ve been making more noise than all the rest of
you put together. The leader’s been casting
grateful looks at me for an hour.”</p>

<p>There was a howl of derision from the others.</p>

<p>“Well,” said a tall, broad-shouldered fellow,
“I don’t intend to yell any more until something
happens, and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yell now, then, Porter,” said Chick gloomily
as the first of the opponents’ batsmen beat the
ball to first by a bare inch. But instead of yelling
Roy Porter merely looked bored, and for a while
there was silence in that particular part of the
stand.</p>

<p>The next Blue batsman bunted toward third,
and although he went out himself, he had
placed the first man on second. The Blue’s best
batters were coming up, and the outlook wasn’t
encouraging. The sharp, short cheer of the Blue’s
adherents rattled forth triumphantly. But
Pritchett wasn’t dismayed. Instead, he settled
down and struck out the next man ignominiously.
Then, with two strikes and two balls called by
the umpire, the succeeding batsman rolled a slow
one toward short-stop and that player, pausing
to hold the runner on second, threw wide of first.
The batsman streaked for second and the man
ahead darted to third and made the turn toward
home. But right-fielder had been prompt in backing
up and the foremost runner was satisfied to
scuttle back to third. The Blue’s first-baseman
came to bat. He was the best hitter on the team,
and, with men on second and third, it seemed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the Blue was destined to wave triumphantly that
day.</p>

<p>“Two down!” called the Crimson captain encouragingly.
“Now for the next one, fellows!
Don’t lose him, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Two out!” bawled the coachers back of first
and third. “Run on anything! Well, I guess
we’ve got them going now! I guess we’ve got
them going! He’s sort of worried, Bill! He’s
sort of worried! <em>Look out!</em>” For the “sort of
worried” one had turned quickly and sped the
ball to third.</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” cried the irrepressible
coacher. “He won’t do that again. Take a
lead; take a lead! Steady!”</p>

<p>Pritchett glanced grimly at the two on bases
and turned to the batsman. He was in a bad
place, and he realized it. A hit would bring in
two runs. The man who faced him was a veteran
player, and couldn’t be fooled easily. He considered
the advisability of giving him his base,
knowing that the next man up would be easier to
dispose of. It was risky, but he decided to do it.
He shook his head at the catcher’s signal and
sent a wide one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ball!” droned the umpire, and the blue flags
waved gleefully.</p>

<p>The next was also a ball, and the next, and the
next, and—</p>

<p>“Take your base,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” muttered Chick nervously as the
man trotted leisurely down the line and the sharp
cheers rattled forth like musketry. “Bases full!”</p>

<p>“He did it on purpose,” said Roy Porter.
“Burton’s a hard-hitter and a clever one, and
Pritchett didn’t want to risk it.”</p>

<p>“Well, a hit now won’t mean a thing!” grieved
Chick.</p>

<p>“It’ll mean two runs; just what it meant before,”
answered Roy. “Who’s this at bat?”</p>

<p>“Kneeland,” answered his neighbor on the
other side, referring to his score-card.</p>

<p>“What’s he done?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Got his base twice, once on fielder’s
choice and once on balls.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. Watch Pritchett fool him.”</p>

<p>They watched, breathlessly, in an agony of suspense.
One ball; one strike; two strikes; two
balls; a foul; another foul.</p>

<p>“He’s spoiling ’em,” muttered Chick uneasily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
But the next moment he was on his feet with
every one else on that side of the field, yelling
wildly, frantically. Pritchett had one more strike-out
to his credit, and three blue-stockinged players
turned ruefully from their captured bases and
sought their places in the field.</p>

<p>The Crimson players came flocking back to the
bench, panting and smiling, and threw themselves
under the grateful shade of the little strip of awning.</p>

<p>“Easy with the water,” cautioned the trainer
as the tin cup clattered against the mouth of the
big water-bottle.</p>

<p>“Who’s up?” asked some one. The coach was
studying the score-book silently. Pritchett was
up, but Pritchett, like most pitchers, was a poor
batsman. The coach’s glance turned and wandered
down the farther bench where the substitutes
sat.</p>

<p>“Eaton up!” he called, and turning to the
scorer: “Eaton in place of Pritchett,” he said.</p>

<p>The youngster who stood before him awaiting
instructions was a rather stockily-built chap, with
brown hair and eyes and a merry, good-natured
face. But there was something besides good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
nature on his face at this moment; something besides
freckles, too; it was an expression that
mingled gratification, anxiety, and determination.
Tom Eaton had been a substitute on the varsity
nine only since the disbanding of the freshman
team, of which he had been captain, and during
that scant fortnight he had not succeeded in getting
into a game.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to get to first, Eaton,” said the
coach softly. “Try and get your base on balls;
make him think you’re anxious to hit, see? But
keep your wits about you and see if you can’t
walk. If he gets two strikes on you, why, do the
best you can; hit it down toward third. Understand?
Once on first I expect you to get around.
Take all the risk you want; we’ve got to score.”</p>

<p>“Batter up!” called the umpire, impatiently.</p>

<p>Eaton selected a bat carefully from the rack
and walked out to the plate. The head cheerleader,
looking over his shoulder, ready to summon
a “short cheer” for the batsman, hesitated
and ran across to the bench.</p>

<p>“Who’s batting?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Eaton,” he was told. “Batting for Pritchett.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“A short cheer for Eaton, fellows, and make it
good!”</p>

<p>It was good, and as the freshman captain faced
the Blue’s pitcher the cheer swept across to him
and sent a thrill along his spine. Perhaps he
needed it, for there is no denying that he was feeling
pretty nervous, although he succeeded in disguising
that fact from either catcher or pitcher.</p>

<p>Up in the cheering section there was joy among
the group of freshmen.</p>

<p>“Look who’s here!” shrieked Chick. “It’s
Chub!”</p>

<p>“Chub Eaton!” cried another. “What do you
think of that?”</p>

<p>“Batting for Pritchett! Say, can he bat much,
Roy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I don’t know what he can do against
this fellow. He hasn’t been in a game since they
took him on. But I guess the coach knows he
can run the bases. If he gets to first I’ll bet he’ll
steal the rest!”</p>

<p>And then the cheer came, and the way those
classmates of Chub’s worked their lungs was a
caution.</p>

<p>In the last inning of a game it is customary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
replace the weak batsman with players who can
hit the ball, and when Chub Eaton stepped to the
plate the Blue’s catcher and pitcher assumed that
they had a difficult person to contend with. The
catcher signaled for a drop, for from the way
Chub handled his bat it seemed that he would, in
baseball slang, “bite at it,” and Chub seemed to
want to badly. He almost swung at it, but he
didn’t quite, and the umpire called “Ball!”
Well, reflected the catcher, it was easy to see that
he was anxious to hit, and so he signaled for a
nice slow ball that looked for all the world like
an easy one until it almost reached the plate; then
it “broke” in a surprising way and went off to
the left. Chub almost reached for it, but, again,
not quite. And “Two balls!” said the umpire.
Chub swung his bat back and forth impatiently,
just begging the Blue pitcher to give him a fair
chance. The pitcher did. He sent a nice drop
that cleared the plate knee-high. “Strike!” announced
the umpire. Chub turned on him in surprise
and shook his head. Then he settled back
and worked his bat in a way that said: “Just try
that again! I dare you to!”</p>

<p>The pitcher did try it again; at least, he seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to, but the ball dropped so low this time that it
failed of being a strike by several inches. Chub
looked pained. On the bench the coach was smiling
dryly. The Blue pitcher awoke to the fact
that he had been fooled. He sent a high ball
straight over the plate and Chub let it go by.
“Strike two!” called the umpire. The Blue
stands cheered mightily. Two strikes and three
balls! Chub gripped his bat hard. Again the
pitcher shot the ball forward. It came straight
and true for the plate, broke when a few feet away
and came down at a weird tangent. Chub swung
desperately and the ball glanced off the bat and
went arching back into the stand. “Foul!”
growled the umpire. Chub drew a deep breath of
relief. Once more the pitcher poised himself and
threw. The ball whirled by him and Chub
dropped his bat and started across the plate, his
heart in his mouth.</p>

<p>“Four balls! Take your base!”</p>

<p>The umpire’s voice was drowned by the sudden
burst of wild acclaim from the Crimson stands,
and Chub trotted to first, to be enthusiastically
patted and thumped on the back by the coacher
stationed there. Up in the cheering section five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
freshmen were hugging each other ecstatically.
The head of the Crimson’s batting list was coming
up, and things looked bright. The cheering
became incessant. The coach shouted and bawled.
But the Blue’s pitcher refused to be rattled. He
settled down, held Chub close on first and, before
any one quite realized what was happening, had
struck out the next man.</p>

<p>But Chub had made up his mind to go on, and
he went. He made his steal on the first ball
thrown to the new batter and, although catcher
threw straight and fast to second-baseman, Chub
slid around the latter and reached the bag. Then,
while the cheers broke forth again, he got up,
patted the dust out of his clothes, and took a fresh
lead. The pitcher eyed him darkly for a moment
and then gave his attention to the batsman.
<em>Crack!</em> Ball and bat met and the short-stop ran
in to field a fast grounder, and as he ran Chub
flashed behind him. Gathering up the ball, short-stop
turned toward third, saw that he was too
late, and threw to first, putting the batsman out
by the narrowest of margins. “Two out!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16-<br />17]</a></span></p>

<p>The Crimson captain stepped to the plate, looking
determined, and hit the first delivery safely.
But it was a bunt near the plate and, although
Chub was ready to run in, he had no chance. The
captain stole second and Chub looked for a chance
to get home; but they were watching him. The
Crimson supporters were on their feet, their
shouts imploring victory. The next man up was
an erratic batsman, one who had made home runs
before this in time of stress and who had, quite as
often, failed to “make good.” Amid the wildest
excitement, the Blue pitcher pulled down his cap,
calmly studied the signal, and sped the ball
toward the plate.</p>

<p>“Strike!” Again, and the batsman swung and
the ball glanced back against the netting.</p>

<p>“Foul! Strike two!”</p>

<p>Then came a ball. The batsman was plainly
discouraged, plainly nervous. Chub, dancing
around at third, worrying the pitcher to the best
of his ability, decided that it was now or never
for him. Taking a long lead, he waited poised
on his toes. As the ball left the pitcher’s hand
he raced for home.</p>

<p>“Hit it! Hit it!” shrieked the men on the
bench. The batsman, awakening suddenly to the
demands, struck wildly as the ball came to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
struck without hitting. But the catcher, with
that red-stockinged figure racing toward him,
made his one error of the game. The ball glanced
from his mitt and rolled back of the plate, and
although he had thrown off his mask and was
after it like a cat after a mouse, he was too late.
<a href="#i_p015">Chub Eaton was lying in a cloud of dust</a> with one
hand on the plate, and the crowd was streaming,
shouting and dancing, onto the field.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">That 4 to 3 victory took place on a Thursday,
in the third week of June.</p>

<p>Some two hours later the hero of the conflict
lay stretched at full length on a window-seat in the
front room of a house within sound of the college
bell. His hands were under his head, one foot
nestled inelegantly amidst the cushions at the far
end of the seat and the other was sprawled upon
the floor. The window beside him was wide open
and through it came the soft, warm air, redolent
of things growing, of moist pavements, of freshly-sprinkled
lawns. The sounds of passing footsteps
and voices entered, too; and from across
the shaded street came the tinkle of a banjo. The
voices were joyous and care-free. To-morrow
was Class-Day; the year’s work was over; books
had been tossed aside, and already the exodus
from college had begun. The twilight deepened
and the long June day came unwillingly to its end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The shadows darkened under the elms and here
and there a light glared out from an open window.
But in the room the twilight held undisputed
sway, hiding the half-packed trunks and the
untidy disorder of the study.</p>

<p>Chub lay on the window-seat and a few feet
away, where he could look through the wide open
casement, Roy Porter was stretched out in a
morris chair. We have already caught a brief
glimpse of Roy in the cheering section during the
game, but in the excitement we did not, I fancy,
observe him very closely. He is a good-looking,
even handsome, boy, with light, curly hair and
very blue eyes. He is tall and well developed,
with broad shoulders and wide hips. Roy and
Chub have been firm friends for three years: for
two years at Ferry Hill School and for one at
college. In age there is but a month or two of
difference between them. Both are freshmen,
having come up together from Ferry Hill last
September, since which time they have led a very
interesting and, withal, happy existence in the
quarters, in which we now find them. And they
have each had their successes. Chub has made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the captaincy of the freshman Nine, they have
both played on the freshman foot-ball team, and
each has been recently taken into one of the societies.
In studies Roy has accomplished rather
more than his friend, having finished the year
well up in his class. But Chub has kept his end
up and has passed the finals, if not in triumph,
at least without disgrace.</p>

<p>“Another big day for you, Chub,” said Roy.
Chub stretched himself luxuriously and yawned.</p>

<p>“Yes. There have been quite a few ‘big days,’
Roy, since we met at school, haven’t there?
There was the day when you lammed out that
home run and won us the game from Hammond,
two years ago. That was one of your ‘big days,’
old chap, but it was mine, too. Then, last year,
when we won on the track. That was Dick’s ‘big
day,’ but we all shared in it, especially since it
brought that check from Kearney and brought the
affairs of the Ferry Hill School Improvement Society
to a glorious close. And then there was the
baseball game last year—”</p>

<p>“That was your day, Chub, and none other’s.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I recollect rightly, there was a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
old two-bagger by one Roy Porter which had
something to do with the result,” returned Chub,
dryly.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’d have won without that. Say, do
you remember Harry after the game?”</p>

<p>“Do I! Shall I ever forget her? She was
just about half crazy, wasn’t she? And wouldn’t
she have loved to have been here to-day?”</p>

<p>They both chuckled at the idea.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Chub presently, “did we
get any mail this evening?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Roy; “but I didn’t
look. Expecting a check?”</p>

<p>“Go to thunder! We ought to hear from Dick
to-day or to-morrow. And Mr. Cole, too, about
the boat.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Maybe we’ll hear in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Light the gas and have a look around,”
begged Chub. “Sometimes Mrs. Moore picks the
letters up and puts them on the table, and we
don’t find them for weeks and weeks.”</p>

<p>“If you’d keep the table picked up,” said Roy,
severely, as he arose with a grunt and fumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for matches, “such things wouldn’t occur.”</p>

<p>“Listen to him!” murmured Chub, apparently
addressing the ceiling. “I’d like to know which
of us is the neat little housekeeper! I’d like to
know—”</p>

<p>The study was suddenly illuminated with a
ghastly glow as Roy applied the match to the
drop-light. Chub groaned and turned his face
away.</p>

<p>“I give you notice, Roy, that next year we’re
going to have a different shade on that thing.
Green may be all very nice for the optic nerves,
but it’s extremely offensive to my—my sensibilities.
Besides, it doesn’t suit my complexion.
I’ve mentioned that before. Now a red shade—”</p>

<p>“Here’s a whole bunch of mail,” exclaimed
Roy, mildly indignant. “I wish she’d let it alone.
Here’s two for you and one for me. This looks
like—yes, it’s from Dick. And I guess this one—”
he studied it under the light—“I guess this is
from the artist man. Anyway, the postmark’s
New York, and—”</p>

<p>“Well, hand ’em over, you idiot,” said Chub.</p>

<p>“Come and get them. You can’t see to read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
over there,” replied Roy tranquilly. Chub hesitated,
groaned, and finally followed the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is from Dickums,” he muttered as
he tore off the end of the envelop. “I hope he
can come. Who’s yours from?”</p>

<p>“Dad,” answered Roy, settling into his chair
and beginning to read. But he wasn’t destined
to finish his letter just then, for in a moment Chub
had rudely disturbed him.</p>

<p>“It’s all right!” he cried. “Listen, Roy; let me
read this to you.”</p>

<p>“He’s coming?” asked Roy eagerly, abandoning
his own letter.</p>

<p>“Yes. Listen.” Chub pulled up a chair, sat
down, and began to read: “‘Dear Chub: Yours
of no date—’”</p>

<p>“Stung!” murmured Roy. Chub grinned and
went on.</p>

<p>—“‘received the day before yesterday. I’d
have answered before, but things have been pretty
busy here. If we can get the house-boat, I’ll go
along in a minute. It will be a fine lark. I’m
leaving here to-morrow for New York. My dad’s
there now, and we’re going to stay somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
around there for the summer, he says. You let me
know just as soon as you can. Send your letter to
the Waldorf. I can start any time. I haven’t
written to Dad about it, but I know he will let
me go. I hope we can get the boat. I told Harry
about it yesterday, and read your letter to her,
and she’s wild to go along. Says we might wait
until she gets back from her Aunt Harriet’s. I
told her there wouldn’t be room but she says
she’d sleep up on top! So I had to tell her
I’d see what you fellows thought about it. Maybe
we might have her along for a little while. What
do you think? I suppose her father or mother
could come, too, as—’”</p>

<p>“Chaperon,” said Roy. “Harry’s getting
‘growed up,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see. Here, where’s that other letter?
Let’s find out what Mr. Cole says.” He
opened the second epistle and glanced through
it quickly, his face lighting as he read. “It’s
all right!” he cried. “We can have her!
Only—” he looked through the brief note again—“only
he doesn’t say anything about the price.
‘When you get here we’ll talk over the matter of
terms.’ That doesn’t sound encouraging, does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
it?” Chub looked across at Roy dubiously, and
Roy shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not very,” he answered; “but you can’t tell.
I guess he will let us down easy. He’s a good
sort, is the Floating Artist.”</p>

<p>“Well—” Chub tossed the note aside and went
back to Dick Somes’s letter. “‘I suppose her
father or mother or some one would have to go
along, but that needn’t make much difference.
She’s wild to know, so you’d better drop her a
line pretty soon and tell her what you think about
it. If you don’t she’s likely to explode!’”</p>

<p>“And that’s so, too, I guess!” chuckled Roy.
“Say, it would be awfully jolly if we four could
get together again this summer, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Dandy!” answered Chub. “And we’ll do it,
too,” he added stoutly.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. Something will happen at
the last moment,” said Roy dejectedly. “You’ll
see.”</p>

<p>“My gentle croaker, let me finish this....
‘I got through exams O. K. and got my diploma
to-day. So I’ll see you fellows in the fall if we
don’t make it before. That is, if I can pass at
college. I wish you’d speak a good word for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to the president. I suppose you know we won
the boat-race by almost three lengths. That
makes up for losing the ball-game. We missed
you on the team this year. They’ve elected Sid
Welch captain for next year. Sid’s so pleased
he can’t see straight. To-day was Class-Day and
we had a fine time. You ought to have heard
me orate. How’s old Roy? He owes me a letter,
the scoundrel. Write as soon as you can to the
Waldorf. I’ll be there to-morrow evening. Tell
Roy to come and see me as soon as he gets home.
You, too, if you stop over there. I’ve got lots
of news for you that I can tell better than I can
write. Hope you fellows win your game to-morrow.
They’d ought to have taken you on, Chub.
But next year, when I get there, I’ll fix that for
you. So long. Don’t forget to let me know
whether we can have the house-boat. Yours,
Dick.’”</p>

<p>“Good old Dickums,” murmured Chub as he
folded the letter. “Well, it’s all settled,” he
went on animatedly. “We’ll take the midnight
train to-morrow, Roy; see Mr. Cole; look up Dick,
and get ready for the cruise! Won’t we have
fun, though?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did Mr. Cole say whether he’d let the boat
to us furnished?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Chub referred to the note. “‘The
<i>Jolly Roger</i> is quite at your disposal as soon as
you want her. I’m going abroad in August, and
won’t want her at all this summer. She needs
paint, but you’ll have to attend to that if you’re
fussy. You’ll find her all ready for you. I won’t
say anything about the engine, for you know that
engine yourself. Treat it kindly and perhaps it
will stand by you. When you get here we’ll talk
over the matter of terms. Regards to your friend
and to you. Very truly yours, Forbes Cole.’
That’s all he says. I don’t believe he will want
us to pay him much if he’s going abroad and
can’t use the boat himself anyway, do you?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” answered Roy, “for it’s going
to be rather an expensive trip, Chub.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! We can run her on ten dollars a
week, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“You forget that we have to eat. You forget
your appetite, Chub.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we have Harry along she can make
doughnuts for us!”</p>

<p>“Well, if she does,” laughed Roy, “I’ll see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
there’s no almond flavoring aboard. Do you remember
last summer when she put almond into
the doughnuts and—”</p>

<p>“Do I remember! I thought I’d never get that
taste out of my mouth!” Chub grinned reminiscently.
Roy arose determinedly and threw back
the lid of his steamer trunk.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“Finish my packing. There won’t be any time
to-morrow, and—”</p>

<p>But alas for good resolutions! There was a
charge of feet outside on the brick walk, a hammering
at the door, and a covey of happy, irresponsible
freshmen burst into the room. There
was no packing that night. But what did it matter?
There was to-morrow and many, many other
to-morrows stretching away in a seemingly limitless
vista of happy holidays, and the fact that
when the visitors finally took their departure the
few things that the roommates had already packed
had been seized upon by rude hands and strewn
about the study worried no one. Nothing matters
when “finals” are over and summer beckons.</p>

<small>AN INVITATION TO MISS EMERY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Two days later three boys were seated about
an up-stairs room in a house in West 57th
Street, New York City. The room was large and
square and tastefully furnished, but you would
have guessed at once that it was a boy’s room;
and the guess would have been correct. Roy Porter
was the host, and his guests were Mr. Thomas
H. Eaton, otherwise known as Chub, and Mr.
Richard Somes, better known as Dick. Dick, as
we have learned through his letter, has just graduated
from Ferry Hill School, and for the present
is staying with his father at a New York hotel.
While Roy lives in New York, and Chub hails
from Pittsburg, Dick claims the distinction of living
nowhere in particular. If you ask him he will
tell you that he lives “out West.” As a matter
of fact, however, he is a nomad. Born in Ohio,
he has successively resided in Nebraska, Montana,
Colorado, Nevada, London, and one or two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
places. His father is a mining man whose business
of buying, selling, and operating mines takes
him to many places. Dick’s mother has been dead
for three years.</p>

<p>Dick himself is big, blond, and seventeen. He
isn’t exactly handsome, judged by accepted
standards of masculine beauty, but he has nice
gray eyes, a smile that wins you at once, and a
pleasant voice. Somehow, in spite of the fact
that nature has endowed him with a miscellaneous
lot of features he is rather attractive; as Chub has
once remarked: “He’s just about as homely as
a mud fence, only somehow you forget all about
it.” It is the crowning sorrow of Dick’s young
life that, owing to his nomadic existence, his
schooling has been somewhat neglected, with the
result that he is a year behind his two friends
and that when he reaches college in the fall—if
he’s lucky enough to get in—he will be only a
freshman, while Roy and Chub are dignified and
superior sophomores. Chub, however, tries to
console him by telling him not to worry, that like
as not he won’t pass the exams!</p>

<p>Chub is staying with Roy, as his guest, and
Dick has taken dinner with them this evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
And now, having left Mr. Porter to his paper in
the library and Mrs. Porter to her book, they
have scurried up to Roy’s room for a good long
talk; for there is much to be said. At the present
moment Roy, sprawled on his bed, is doing the
talking.</p>

<p>“It was Chub’s scheme in the first place, Dick.
He thought of it two months ago when we were
down by the river one day. There’s an old boat-house
on a raft down there, and Chub said it reminded
him of the <i>Jolly Roger</i>. I said I didn’t
see the resemblance, and he said all you had to do
was to turn it around and it would be just like
the <i>Jolly Roger</i>.”</p>

<p>“Turn it around?” asked Dick, mystified.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Chub. “Turn a boat-house
around and you have a house-boat. See?”</p>

<p>“College hasn’t taught you much sense, Chub,
has it?” laughed Dick. “Then what, Roy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, then Chub got to talking about what fun
Mr. Cole must have in his house-boat and how
he’d like to go knocking around in one. And then
we remembered that Mr. Cole had told us last
summer that the <i>Jolly Roger</i> was for sale. Of
course, we knew we couldn’t buy it, but we thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
maybe he’d be willing to rent it for the summer.
And, finally a week or so ago, we wrote him—”</p>

<p>“<em>We?</em>” queried Chub.</p>

<p>“Well, then, <em>you</em> wrote him, Chubbie my boy;
but I supplied the stamp. And yesterday—no,
the day before yesterday—we got his note; and
to-morrow we’re all going to call at his studio
and find out how much he wants for it for the
summer.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Dick enthusiastically. “And
where are we going in it?”</p>

<p>“I thought it would be fun to go down Long
Island Sound, but Chub wants to go up the river.”</p>

<p>“Up the Hudson? That would be great! We
could go away up to—to Buffalo—”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’d get there about November,”
laughed Chub. “The <i>Jolly Roger</i> goes about as
fast as—as a mule walks!”</p>

<p>“Bet you Dick really thinks Buffalo is on the
Hudson,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” asked Dick in surprise. “I did
think it was; honest. Where is it, then?”</p>

<p>“It—it’s on—you tell him, Roy.”</p>

<p>“It’s on a lake.”</p>

<p>“It’s on Niagara Falls,” added Chub knowingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
“Bounded on the north by Canada, on the
east by the St. Lawrence River, on the south by the
United States of America and on the west by—by
water. Its principal exports are buffaloes
and—and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” said Roy. “Anyhow, we could
go up as far as Troy—”</p>

<p>“And get our laundry done,” suggested Chub.</p>

<p>“And we could stop for a while at Ferry Hill
and see the school and the Doctor and Mrs. Em
and Harry—”</p>

<p>“What I want to know—” began Dick.</p>

<p>“And we could stay at Fox Island a day or
two. It would be like old times.”</p>

<p>“You mean Harry’s Island,” corrected Dick.
“What I want to know, though, is whether we can
take Harry along.”</p>

<p>“Chub thinks we can,” answered Roy; “but I
don’t see how we could manage it.”</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” said Chub. “There’s three
rooms we can use for sleeping. Harry and her
mother, or whoever came along with her, could
have the big room up front or the little room at
the rear, the one Mr. Cole used as a studio.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s only as big as a piece of cheese,” said
Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, they’d only want to sleep in it. They
could have that, and the rest of us could have the
bedroom and living-room. We’d need some cot-beds—there’s
a bully bed in the bedroom now,
you know—and some sheets and blankets and
things. Pshaw, we could fix it up easy!”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s crazy to go,” said Dick; “and she
made me promise to ask you chaps.”</p>

<p>“When does she go away to her aunt’s?” asked
Roy.</p>

<p>“The day after to-morrow; and she’s going to
stay two weeks. That is, if she can come with us.
If not she’ll stay three, I believe. Did you write
to her, Roy?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” Roy answered. “I thought we’d
get together and talk it over. If you fellows
think we can arrange it I’d be mighty glad to
have her. She’s a whole lot of fun, Harry is.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s take her along,” said Dick eagerly.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Chub. “Let’s write to her now.
Where’s your paper and things, Roy?”</p>

<p>They all had a hand in the composition of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
letter, and when finished and signed it ran as follows;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

else you want to. Come prepared for a good time. All
principal foreign ports will be visited, including Troy,
Athens, Cairo, and Schenectady. The catering will be
in the hands of that world-renowned chef, Mr. Dickums
Somes, formerly of Camp Torohadik, Harry’s Island.
Kindly reply as soon as possible to address above.
Trusting that you will consent to grace the house-boat

</p></div>

<p>“What’s A.B. mean?” asked Roy, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“It means Able Seaman,” replied Chub. “I
put it that way because it’s probably the only
chance you’ll ever have of getting your A.B.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose, do you,” asked Dick anxiously,
“that she’ll take that literally: about
bringing any one else she wants to? She might
think we meant her to bring a crowd, a bunch
of girls from that school of hers.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better change that a little,”
agreed Roy.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll say ‘Bring your doughnut recipe
and any other one person you want to.’ How’s
that?”</p>

<p>“All right; although, of course, a doughnut recipe
isn’t a person.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just a joke,” laughed Chub.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better label it?” asked Dick innocently.
“How is she going to know it’s a
joke?”</p>

<p>“She has more discernment than some others
I wot of,” replied Chub loftily.</p>

<p>“Well, if she wots that that’s a joke,” muttered
Dick, “she’s certainly a pretty good
wotter.”</p>

<p>“Who’s got a stamp?” asked Chub as he finished
scrawling the address on the envelop.
“Thanks. What a very nasty tasting one! I
wonder why the government doesn’t flavor its
stamps better. It might turn them out in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
flavors, you know; peppermint, vanilla, wintergreen,
chocolate—”</p>

<p>“Almond,” suggested Roy.</p>

<p>“And then when you went to the post-office you
could say: ‘I’d like ten twos, please; peppermint,
if you have it.’”</p>

<p>“You’re an awful idiot,” laughed Dick. “Give
me the letter and I’ll post it on the way to the
hotel. Now, let’s talk about what we’ll have to
buy. Let’s figure up and see what it’ll cost us.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Chub readily. “I’ve got a
pencil.”</p>

<p>“First of all, then, we’ll need a lot of provisions.”</p>

<p>“Unless we can persuade Chub to stay behind,”
suggested Roy.</p>

<p>“Who thought of this scheme?” asked Chub
indignantly. “I guess if any one stays behind
it won’t be Chub. And likewise and moreover
if Chub doesn’t have enough to eat he will
mutiny.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to put yourself in irons,”
said Dick, “if you’re in command.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that!” Chub bit the end of
the pencil and frowned. “Maybe I’d rather be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the crew than the captain. If you’re captain you
can’t mutiny, and I’ve always wanted to mutiny.
Say, wouldn’t it be great if we could be pirates?
We could put up that skull-and-cross-bones flag
and board one of the Day Line steamboats. Think
of the sport we could have! We’d swipe all the
grub on board of her and make the officers walk
the plank! Then—then we’d scuttle her!”</p>

<p>“How do you scuttle a boat?” asked Dick curiously.</p>

<p>Chub for a moment was at a loss, and glanced
doubtfully at Roy. But finding no assistance
there he plunged bravely.</p>

<p>“Well, you first get a scuttle, just an ordinary
scuttle, you know; and I think you have to have
a coal-shovel, too, but I’m not quite certain about
that. Armed with the scuttle you descend to
the—the cellar of the ship—”</p>

<p>“You bore holes in it,” said Roy contemptuously.
“Thunder! I’m not going to ship under
a captain who doesn’t know the rudiments of
navigation.”</p>

<p>“I’m not talking navigation,” said Chub with
dignity. “I’m talking piracy. Piracy is a much
more advanced study. Anybody can navigate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
but good pirates are few and far between, these
days.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on and talk sense,” begged Dick.
“How much will it cost us for grub?”</p>

<p>“Well, let me see,” responded Chub, turning
to his paper. “I suppose about two cases of
eggs—But, look here, we haven’t decided how
long we’re going to cruise.”</p>

<p>“A month,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Two months,” said Dick. “Anyway, we can’t
buy enough eggs at the start to last us all the
time. Eggs should be fresh.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get eggs and vegetables as we go
along,” said Roy. “What we have to have to
start with are staples.”</p>

<p>“Mighty hard eating,” murmured Chub.
“Why not use plain nails?”</p>

<p>This was treated by the others with contemptuous
silence.</p>

<p>“We’ll need flour, coffee, tea, salt, rice,
cheese—”</p>

<p>“Pepper,” interpolated Dick.</p>

<p>“Baking-powder, sugar, flavoring extracts—”</p>

<p>“Mustard,” proposed Chub, “for mustard plasters,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“And lots of things like that,” ended Roy triumphantly.</p>

<p>“What we need is a grocery,” sighed Chub.
“Aren’t we going to have any meat at all? I
have a very delicate stomach, fellows, and the
doctor insists on meat three times a day. Personally,
I don’t care for it much; I’m a vegetarian
by conviction and early training; but one can’t
go against the doctor’s orders, you know. Now,
for breakfast a small rasher of bacon—”</p>

<p>“What’s a rasher?” Roy demanded.</p>

<p>“For luncheon a—er—two or three simple little
chops, and for dinner a small roast of beef or
lamb or a friendly steak. Those, with a few vegetables
and an occasional egg, suffice my simple
needs. I might mention, however, that a suggestion
of sweet, such as a plum-pudding, a mince-pie
or a dab of ice-cream, has always seemed to
me a proper topping off to a meal, if I may use the
expression.”</p>

<p>“You may use any expression you like,” answered
Roy cruelly, “but if you think we’re going
to have roasts you’ve got another guess coming to
you. Why, that kitchen—”</p>

<p>“Galley,” corrected Chub helpfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>—“is too small for anything bigger than a
French chop!”</p>

<p>“When Chub gets awfully hungry,” observed
Dick, “we might tie up to the shore and cook him
something over the fire; have a barbecue, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Cook a whole ox for him,” laughed Roy. “I
guess that’s the only way Chub will ever get
enough to eat.”</p>

<p>“You quit bothering about me,” said Chub
scornfully, “and study seamanship. Remember
you’re to be an able seaman and if you don’t come
up to the standard for able seaman I’ll do things
to you with a belaying-pin.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the cruel-hearted captain?” asked
Dick. “I don’t believe I want to ship with him,
Roy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll be all right. Chub won’t dare to
touch you for fear he won’t get his dinner.”</p>

<p>“There you go again!” Chub groaned. “You
fellows simply talk a subject to death. Your conversation
lacks—lacks variety, diversity. If you
are quite through vilifying me—”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he use lovely language?” murmured
Roy in an aside to Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“We will now proceed with our estimate,” concluded
Chub. “As I was saying, eggs—”</p>

<p>“I tell you what we might use,” interrupted
Dick. “Have you ever seen any of this powdered
egg?”</p>

<p>“Is this a joke?” asked Chub darkly.</p>

<p>“No, really! You buy it in cans. It’s eggs,
just the yolks, you know, with all the moisture
taken out of them. It’s a yellow powder. And
when you want an omelet you just mix some milk
with it and stir it up and there you are!”</p>

<p>But Chub was suspicious.</p>

<p>“And how do you make a fried egg out of it?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“You can’t, of course, because the whites aren’t
there; but—”</p>

<p>“Then we want none of it! An egg that you
can’t fry isn’t a respectable egg. If I can’t have
real eggs I’ll starve like a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s leave the eggs out of it for the
present,” suggested Roy. “Let’s figure on the
other things.”</p>

<p>“Let’s not,” said Dick, rising. “I’m going
home. We’ve got lots of time to figure. Besides,
the best way to do is to buy the things and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
let the groceryman do the figuring. We’ve got
to have them, no matter what they cost. What
time are we going around to see the Floating
Artist?”</p>

<p>“Right after breakfast,” answered Chub.
“You come up at about ten o’clock—”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you fellows coming to
the hotel and having breakfast with me?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“All right, then, luncheon. I’ll be around at
ten in the morning. See if you can at least get
him up by that time, Roy.”</p>

<p>“With a glance of scathing contempt,” murmured
Chub, “our hero turned upon his heel and
strode rapidly away into the fast-gathering darkness.”</p>

<p>But where he really strode was down the stairs,
with one arm over Dick’s shoulder, while Roy
brought up the rear and gently prodded them
with the toe of his shoe.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>LEASING A HOUSE-BOAT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The preceding summer, while camping out on
Fox Island—or Harry’s Island, as they
called it now—the boys had made the acquaintance
of the Floating Artist. He had appeared
one day in his house-boat, the <i>Jolly Roger</i>, in
which he was cruising down the Hudson, sketching
as he went. His real name was Forbes Cole,
a name of much importance in the art world, as
the boys discovered later on. He had proved an
agreeable acquaintance, and when camp had been
broken the three boys, together with Harry
Emery, the daughter of the school principal, had
voyaged with him as far as New York.</p>

<p>Mr. Cole lived in a rather imposing white stone
house within sight of the Park. The entrance
was on the level with the sidewalk. Bay-trees in
green tubs flanked the door which was guarded
by a bronze grilling. The three boys were admitted
by a uniformed butler and conducted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a tiny white-and-gold reception-room. As the
heavy curtain fell again at the doorway after the
retreating servant the visitors gazed at each
other with awed surprise. Chub pretended to be
fearful of trusting his weight to the slender
chairs, and all three were grinning and giggling
when the man appeared again, suddenly and noiselessly.
Down a marble-tiled hall carpeted with
narrow Oriental rugs in dull colors they were led
to an elevator. When they were inside, the butler
touched a button and the tiny car, white-and-gold
like the reception-room, shot up past two floors
and stopped, apparently of its own volition, at the
third, and the boys emerged to find themselves <a href="#i_p049">in
a great studio</a> that evidently occupied the whole
fourth floor of the house.</p>

<p>“Talk about your Arabian Nights!” murmured
Chub in Roy’s ear.</p>

<p>The grating closed quietly behind them, the car
disappeared and they stood looking about
them in bewilderment and pleasure. So far as
they could see the big apartment was empty of
any persons save themselves, but they couldn’t
be certain of that for there were shadowy recesses
where the white light from the big skylights
didn’t penetrate, and a balcony of dark, richly
carved oak, screened and curtained, stretched
across the front end of the studio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_48">In a great studio</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50-<br />51]</a></span></p>

<p>At the other end a broad fireplace was flanked
by a tall screen of Spanish leather which glowed
warmly where the light found it. A white bearskin
was laid in front of it. Other rugs were
scattered here and there, queer, low-toned prayer
rugs many of them, with tattered borders and
silky sheen. The walls were hung with tapestries
against which was the dull glitter of armor.
Strange vessels of pottery and copper and brass
stood about, and two big, black oak chests, elaborately
carved, half hidden by silken cushions and
embroideries, guarded the fireplace. There was a
dais under the skylight, and on it was a chair. At
a little distance was a big easel holding a canvas,
and beside it a cabinet for paints and brushes.
There were few pictures in sight, but over the
room hung a faint and not unpleasant odor of
paint and oil and turpentine.</p>

<p>At one of the broad, low windows—there were
only two and both were wide open—was a great
jar of yellow roses. Under the window was a
wide seat upholstered in green leather and piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with cushions. And amidst the cushions, a fact
only now discerned by the visitors, lay a red setter
viewing them calmly with big brown eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s Jack,” Chub whispered. “I’ve met him
before. He’s sure to chew holes in us if we stir.
Little Chub stays right here until help comes.”</p>

<p>But evidently Jack had become interested, for
he slowly descended from the window-seat and
came across the room, his tail wagging slowly.</p>

<p>“We’d better run,” counseled Chub in pretended
terror.</p>

<p>But the red setter’s intentions were apparently
friendly. He sniffed at Roy and allowed himself
to be patted. Then he walked around to Dick and
Chub and completed his investigations, finally becoming
quite enthusiastic in his welcome and digging
his nose into Chub’s hand.</p>

<p>“Bet you he knows us!” cried Chub, softly and
delightedly. “The rascal forgets that the first time
we met he made a face at me and growled. Well,
all is forgiven, Jack. Where’s your master, sir?”</p>

<p>“I suppose we might as well sit down,” said
Roy, “instead of standing here like a lot of ninnies.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such a place in your life?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
asked Dick. “It looks like a museum and a palace
all rolled into one!”</p>

<p>“Gee, but I wish I was an artist!” sighed Chub.
“I wonder what’s on the easel. Do you think we
could look?”</p>

<p>“No, I think we’ll go over there and sit down
and not snoop,” answered Roy severely. “Come
on.”</p>

<p>But at that moment the elevator door rolled
softly open and with a start the boys turned to
see their host step out of the car. Forbes Cole
was one of the biggest men they had ever seen.
He was well over six feet high and, it seemed,
more than proportionately broad. He was a fine,
handsome looking man with a big head of wavy
brown hair, kindly, twinkling blue eyes, and a
brown beard trimmed to a point under a strong
chin.</p>

<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting,” he said as he
shook hands all around. “I was just finishing
breakfast. And how are you all? Let me see,
this is Roy, isn’t it? I remember every one of
you perfectly, but I have a bad memory for
names. Chub, though, I recollect very well; that
name happens to stick. And this is Dick Somes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Yes, yes, now I’ve got you all. Jack seems to
have remembered you, too. Come over here and
sit down and tell me what great things have happened
to you since we parted last year. I suppose
each one of you has done something fine for your
school or college. Dear, dear, what a beautiful
thing it is to be young! We never realize it until
it’s too late. Now what’s the news?”</p>

<p>They perched themselves side by side on the
broad window-seat and the artist lifted the heavy
chair from the dais with one hand as though it
weighed but an ounce and sprawled his great
body in it. Jack settled back amongst the cushions
with his head on Dick’s knee.</p>

<p>“I guess there isn’t much to tell,” said Roy.
“Chub and I have been at college and Dick here is
coming up in the fall.”</p>

<p>“If I can pass,” muttered Dick.</p>

<p>“And Miss Harry? How is she?” asked Mr.
Cole.</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Dick. “I saw her the other
day. We often talk about you, sir, and the good
times we had on the <i>Jolly Roger</i>.”</p>

<p>“And so you think you’d like to have more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
good times on it, eh?” laughed the artist in his
jovial roar. “I wish I could go along, if you’d
have me; but I’m going across after awhile. But
the boat’s yours when you want it, and I hope
you’ll have the jolliest sort of a time, boys.”</p>

<p>“It’s mighty nice of you to want us to have
it,” said Roy. “We’ll take very good care of it,
Mr. Cole, and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother about that,” laughed the
painter. “You know I’ve got tired of it, boys.
Besides, it’s well insured and if it happens to go
to the bottom, why, I sha’n’t mind a bit—as long
as you get out first! She’s at Loving’s Landing,
if you know where that is; about fifteen miles up
the river. You’ll find her in good condition, I
guess. I wrote the man day before yesterday to
open her up and get her in shape. She needs
paint, as I wrote you; but I don’t believe I want
to go to the expense of having her done over. But
if you think you’d rather have her freshened up
it won’t cost much to have Higgins put on one
coat for you.”</p>

<p>“I guess she’s all right as she is,” said Chub.
He looked at Roy and that youth took the hint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“We were wondering,” he began, “how much
you’d want for her for a couple of months, Mr.
Cole.”</p>

<p>“You can have her all summer for the same
price,” answered the painter with his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we couldn’t stay in her more
than two months, sir; but of course we realize
that if we took her we ought to pay for the whole
time, because it would be too late to rent her
again after we were through with her, I guess.
About how much would she be, sir?”</p>

<p>Mr. Cole looked at them thoughtfully for a moment.
Finally,</p>

<p>“Well, I was going to ask you to take her and
use her rent free,” he answered, “but there’s
something in Roy’s expression that tells me I’d
get sat on if I did.” He laughed merrily. “Am
I right?”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t sit on you,” answered Chub,
“but we’d feel—feel better about it if we
rented it regularly from you. It’s mighty good
of you, though.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t, Chub. It isn’t mighty good for
anyone to be generous when it doesn’t cost him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
anything. The boat’s of no use to me this summer
and I shouldn’t rent it under any conditions—except
to you boys. But if you’d rather not
take it as a gift, why, I’ll have to put a price on
it.” He thought a moment. “Suppose we say
fifty dollars for the summer?”</p>

<p>Chub eyed Roy doubtfully and Roy eyed Dick.</p>

<p>“That sounds like an awful little bit,” said Roy
at last.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” replied their host. “I
doubt if the <i>Jolly Roger’s</i> worth much more, fellows.
I’m satisfied and I don’t see why you
shouldn’t be. You won’t let me do you a favor,
although I thought we were pretty good friends
last summer, but, on the other hand, I don’t think
you ought to insist on my driving a hard bargain
with you. Fifty dollars is my valuation, and
there you are; I refuse to go up another cent!”</p>

<p>“In that case,” laughed Roy, “I guess we’d
better accept your terms, sir. And we’re very
much obliged.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right then. I’ll give you a note to
Higgins; the boat’s in his yard up there; and you
can take her over as soon as you like and keep her
as long as you wish. That’s settled. Now tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
me what you’ve been doing the three of you.
How do you like your college?”</p>

<p>The boys stayed for another hour and talked
and were shown over the studio and were invited
to luncheon. But although Chub frowned and
nodded his head emphatically Roy politely declined.
They finally left with the lease of the
house-boat <i>Jolly Roger</i> in Roy’s pocket, promising
to call again after they had looked over the
craft. Then they shook hands, entered the elevator
car and were dropped to the street floor.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk <a href="#i_p059">Roy</a> turned to the others.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up and see the boat this afternoon,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Let’s go now!” exclaimed Chub with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Can’t; after making up that fifty dollars there
isn’t enough money in the crowd to pay the car-fares.
No, we’ll go along with Dick and have
luncheon. When we get to the hotel we’ll find
out how to get to Loving’s Landing, and then
we’ll start out right after luncheon. What do
you say?”</p>

<p>Chub and Dick agreed to the plan and the three
strode off toward Dick’s hostelry.</p>

<small>A TRIP OF INSPECTION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It turned out when they got there that the real
host was not Dick, but Dick’s father. Neither
Roy nor Chub had met Mr. Somes before.
Like Mr. Cole he was a large man, but his size was
rather a matter of breadth and thickness than
height. He had a round, clean-shaven, jovial
face lighted by a pair of keen steel-gray eyes, and
a deep, rumbly voice that seemed to come from
the heavy-soled shoes he affected. But he was
kindness itself, and by the time they had gathered
about the table beside the open window in the big
hotel dining-room Roy and Chub were quite captivated.
And that luncheon! Chub talks of it yet!
There was ice-cold cantaloupe to start with, and
then cold bouillon, and tiny clams lying on shells
no larger than half-dollars, and chops not much
larger than the clams—so small, in fact, that
Chub viewed them with dismay until he discovered
that there were many, many of them,—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
potato croquettes, and pease no larger than birdshot,
and Romaine salad, and—but, dear me,
no one save Chub can give the entire program at
this late day! I know there were lemon tarts and
strawberry ice-cream and all sorts of astonishing
cakes at the end, though; and I know that Chub
was never much more miserable in his life than
when he was obliged to stop eating with half
his portion of ice-cream unconsumed! Of course
such a repast took time, and after it was over no
one seemed in any very great hurry to leave the
table. So they sat there contentedly while Mr.
Somes, craftily led on by Dick, told marvelous
stories of mines and discoveries, until Chub was
for abandoning the cruise in the <i>Jolly Roger</i> and
starting west to prospect for gold. It was almost
the middle of the afternoon when they finally left
the dining-room, and then a hasty consultation
of the time-table showed them that to reach Loving’s
Landing that day and return in time for dinner
was quite out of the question. Roy and Dick
were a little disappointed, but Chub took it philosophically.</p>

<p>“We can go up in the morning just as well,”
he said. “We can go any day, but it isn’t every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
day a chap gets the chance of a feed like that.
It’s all right for you fellows to make fun, but you
haven’t been in training for two months, living
on beef and potatoes and rice puddings! I’m not
kicking though,” he added softly and reverently,
“for that luncheon pretty nearly made up for it
all!”</p>

<p>So instead of going to Loving’s Landing they
ambled downtown, feeling very contented and
peaceful, and obtained a price-list from one of the
big grocery houses. Armed with this they returned
to Dick’s room and made out a long list
of purchases. There is no use in setting it down
here, for when they reckoned up they found that
it came to over ninety dollars! In disgust Roy
crumpled it up and threw it into the waste-basket.</p>

<p>“We’re awful idiots,” he said. “What’s the
good of wasting our time up here when we might
be out of doors? Let’s go and have a walk in the
Park.”</p>

<p>Chub, reclining at full length on Dick’s bed,
groaned dismally.</p>

<p>“‘Strenuous’ is a much over-worked word,
Roy,” he said, “but it certainly applies to you.
Just when I’m beginning to feel comfortable you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
ask me to get up and walk! <em>Walk!</em> If you’d said
ride, now—”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s,” said Dick. “Let’s get on the
top of one of those silly Fifth Avenue stages and
bump uptown. It’s lots of fun, honest; you think
every minute that the fool thing’s going to topple
over!”</p>

<p>“What joy!” murmured Chub. “Let us go.
I’m the neat little toppler. Besides, maybe it will
help settle my luncheon and give me an appetite
for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Roy. “You’re not
thinking about dinner already are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of nothing else,” responded
Chub. “Hang it, you fellows don’t seem to realize
that I’ve got two months of starvation to
make up for! Come on and let us topple.”</p>

<p>But although they went to the end of the route
in both directions the coach failed to turn over,
but there were several occasions when Chub
screamed with delight and told the others that the
moment was at hand.</p>

<p>“Now we’re going!” Chub cried. “Stand
back, men! Women and children first!” And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
when the danger was over he shook his head disappointedly.
“I shall ask for my money back,”
he declared warmly. “What kind of service do
you call this, anyway? Here I am out for a pleasant
afternoon topple and nothing doing! I believe
I could have some one arrested for this.”
He looked darkly about him in search of a victim.
“The first policeman I see I shall make complaint
to. It’s an outrage, a perfect outrage!”</p>

<p>But when they reached Roy’s house the prospect
of dinner had restored his good-humor. Dick
dined with them, and in the evening they went to
the theater.</p>

<p>Theoretically it is a simple matter to journey
from New York to Loving’s Landing. Actually
it is much more difficult, especially when you mistake
the train as the three did the next forenoon
and find yourself hurrying off in quite the wrong
direction. By the time they were able to get out
of that train they had wasted fourteen miles. By
the time they were back in the station, ready to
start over again, they had squandered nearly
three quarters of an hour. Roy was inclined to
be angry, laying the blame, by some remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
method of reasoning, on the railroad company.</p>

<p>“What did that fellow tell us Track 12 for?” he
asked irascibly.</p>

<p>“There, there,” said Chub soothingly, “don’t
waste your time trying to find out why anybody
does anything in a railroad station. They have
laws of their own, Roy, laws that you and I will
never comprehend. It was our fault. We ought
to know by this time that no one in a station ever
tells the truth on any subject. I’ll just bet you
that if I go over there and ask that gateman how
to get to Loving’s Landing he will tell me all
wrong.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to ask someone,” said Dick,
“and it might as well be him. He looks as intelligent
as most of them I’ve seen.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll ask him, but of course he will lie to
me.” Chub was back in a minute shaking his
head dismally. “He <em>says</em> Track 8, and that
there’s a train in about four minutes, but of
course—”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Roy impatiently, “don’t
let’s lose another.”</p>

<p>They sought Track 8, Chub expostulating
against the folly of believing the gateman. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
both the conductor and the brakeman assured them
earnestly that the train did go to Loving’s Landing,
and after some persuasion Chub allowed himself
to be dragged aboard.</p>

<p>“Have your own way,” he sighed. “But when
you get out in Chicago or Cincinnati or New Orleans
don’t blame me, don’t blame me! I wash
my hands of the whole undertaking.”</p>

<p>“I guess it won’t hurt them,” answered Dick
cruelly.</p>

<p>Loving’s Landing, at first sight, didn’t appear
to be worth the trouble they had taken to find it.
It was largely composed of lumberyards, machine-shops
and wharves in front of which dirty
little canal-boats were lying. Higgins’s Boat Yard
was difficult to discover, each informant directing
them differently, but at last they found it
tucked away between the railroad and the
river and hidden by a lumberyard. They presented
their credentials at the office and were directed
to where the <i>Jolly Roger</i> lay ready for
launching. By that time Chub was speculating on
the chances of obtaining luncheon in such a “one-horse
metropolis.”</p>

<p>The <i>Jolly Roger</i> lay at the top of the way, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
end tilted high in air. It was something of a
feat to board her and more of a feat to move
around after they were there. The doors and
windows had been opened but the interior still
had a musty odor that caused Roy to sniff in
displeasure. For the next half-hour they roamed
around in and out, planning and making memoranda
of things to buy. The boat was furnished
just as when they had last seen it, although
the hauling out had seriously displaced many of
the articles. In the forward cabin,—or living-room,
just as you had a mind to call it,—chairs
and table had congregated against one wall as
though holding a conference.</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Chub, “we’re going to
need a lot of things. We ought to have new curtains
all over the shop, cot-beds, bedding, some
more chairs—”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got those all down,” answered
Roy shortly. “What is most important. I fancy,
is to have someone go over the engine.”</p>

<p>“You bet,” Dick agreed. “We can do without
new curtains better than we can do without an engine.
I’ve been looking at the batteries and wiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and they’re all out of kilter. We’d better
consult Higgins and find some one who can fix up
that part of it.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t look much as she did last summer,”
said Chub disappointedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, she will when she gets in the water and
we have her fixed up,” Dick replied. “How about
painting her outside?”</p>

<p>They climbed down and had a look at her from
the wharf, finally agreeing that a coat of white on
the house was necessary. Then they found the
boat builder and talked it all over with him. As
soon as he found that there was a prospect of
work to be done he was all attention. He agreed
to take charge of the matter, paint her as directed,
have the engine and batteries thoroughly
gone over and deliver her at a certain dock in the
North River, New York, in one week’s time.</p>

<p>“Of course he’s lying, too,” said Chub gloomily
as they made their way out of the yard, “but it’s
a sweet lie. I don’t suppose he will have her ready
before the middle of July. Some one of us will
have to come up here every day or so and get
after him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” answered Dick, “Roy and
I will camp on his trail, and by the time you come
back she’ll be all ready.”</p>

<p>Chub allowed himself to be comforted, and they
set forth in search of luncheon. They found it,
but the least said of it the better. The next morning
Chub left for Pittsburg, having bound himself
as one condition of the agreement with his
father to spend a week at home before beginning
the cruise in the house-boat. While he was away
Roy and Dick fulfilled their promise to keep after
Mr. Higgins, and that worthy responded finely to
encouragement. The boys went to Loving’s Landing
three times during the week, the last time bearing
with them the new curtains which had been
purchased by Mrs. Porter and made under her directions.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72-<br />73]</a></span></p>

<p class="noi">There were other purchases, too; cot-beds
that folded into almost nothing when not in
use, blankets, sheets, mattresses, and pillows,
dishes and a few extra cooking utensils, new records
for Mr. Cole’s talking machine, two brightly-hued
and inexpensive Japanese rugs for the upper
deck and numerous lesser things. The provisions
were left to the last. They kept up an incessant
and animated correspondence with Chub who
hated to have anything done without getting a
finger in it, and altogether that was a busy week.
At the end of it, strange to say, the <i>Jolly Roger</i>
actually appeared in her berth in the river, and
the next afternoon <a href="#i_p071">Chub descended at the Porter’s
bag and baggage</a>.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">When I say that Chub arrived “bag and baggage,”
I mean every word of it.</p>

<p>It was a delightful afternoon—July was almost
a week old—and Roy, pausing before his front
door and fumbling for his latch-key, looked westward
along the street into a golden haze of sunlight.
And as he looked, suddenly there appeared,
huge and formless in the sunset glow, something
that arrested his attention. For a moment he
couldn’t make it out, but presently, with a rattle
of wheels, it drew near and resolved into a “four-wheeler”
piled high with luggage. It pulled up
at the curb before the door, and Chub leaped out,
bringing with him numerous packages.</p>

<p>“Hello,” greeted Roy; “come to spend the rest
of your days with us? Why didn’t you bring the
grand piano? Or is it in the big trunk there?”</p>

<p>Chub grinned and directed the transfer of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
belongings from cab to house. There was a small
steamer trunk, a whopping wicker trunk, a suit
case, a case containing fishing rods, a case containing
a shot-gun, three brown paper parcels, an
umbrella, and a rain coat. The largest trunk was
placed in the rear hall down-stairs, but the other
things were carried up to Chub’s room. And
when the confusion was over and the cabman, liberally
rewarded, had rattled away, Chub deigned
to explain.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a raft of stuff?” he asked, throwing
himself into a chair. “You see, Roy, after I’d
got all packed up I came across two or three
things I thought would be nice for the boat, and
as there wasn’t time to do anything else, I just
wrapped them up and brought them along. That
big bundle is a corn and asparagus boiler, and—”</p>

<p>“A <em>what</em>?”</p>

<p>“Corn and asparagus boiler. It’s a great
thing. I found it in the kitchen cupboard. It’s
sort of oblong, you know, and there’s a tray that
lifts out with the corn on it when it’s done. You
see, we’re likely to have a lot of green corn and
I was pretty sure we didn’t have anything big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
enough to cook it in. Good idea, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” said Roy. “Did they know you
were taking it?”</p>

<p>“They do by this time,” laughed Chub. “I
forget whether I made any special mention of it.
There were so many things at the last moment,
you see. That littlest bundle is a barometer.
Every boat ought to have a barometer, so I borrowed
it from the front porch. And the other—”</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t tell me,” sighed Roy. “I
know what’s in that. It’s a sewing machine.”</p>

<p>“You run away and play! It’s a pair of white
canvas shoes. I found them after the trunks had
gone and there wasn’t room for them in the bag.”</p>

<p>“And, without wishing to appear unduly inquisitive,”
said Roy, “may I ask what the large
trunk down-stairs contains? You said it wasn’t
the piano, I believe?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you after dinner,” answered Chub.
“I’ve got a lot of useful things in there. What
time is it? After six? Then I must wash off
some of this dust. My! it was a grimy old trip.”</p>

<p>“It must have been. How are the folks?”</p>

<p>“Splendid! They’re getting ready to go to the
Water Gap. My, but I’m glad I don’t have to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
too! I suppose, though, I’ll have to go there
for a while in September. Is the boat done yet?
Have you seen it?”</p>

<p>After dinner Dick appeared and Chub solved
the mystery of the wicker trunk. The entire
household gathered in the back hall while he displayed
his treasures.</p>

<p>“What do you say to those?” asked Chub, pulling
four sofa cushions out. “They’ll be just the
thing for the window-seat in the forward cabin,
eh?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got pillows for that window-seat,”
said Dick.</p>

<p>“How many?” asked Chub, scathingly.
“About six! We need a lot. Mother said I could
have these just as well as not for the summer, so
I bagged them. And look here! Camp-stools,
don’t you see? You open them out like—like this—no,
like this!—yes, this must be the way they go—how
the dickens?—there we are! See? When
we don’t need them they fold up out of the way—<em>ouch!</em>”
Chub had folded one of his fingers in
the operation.</p>

<p>“They’re fine!” laughed Roy. “We can use
them on the roof.”</p>

<p>“Upper deck, please,” Dick requested.
“What’s the red blanket, Chub?”</p>

<p>“That’s a steamer rug, and it’s a fine one.
Feel the warmth of it. I thought maybe we’d
want extra covers some time. And there’s an old
foot-ball—”</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Oh, we may want to kick it around some time
when we’re ashore. It’ll be something to do.
And this is an old sweater; I thought I’d just
bring it along. And here’s a small ice-cream
freezer. It only makes a quart, but that’ll be
enough, I guess. And that’s a bag of salt.
Mother thought I might as well bring it as buy
new.”</p>

<p>By this time the audience was frankly hilarious.</p>

<p>“But do you know how to make ice-cream,
Chub?” asked Mrs. Porter.</p>

<p>“Oh, anybody can make ice-cream,” he answered
carelessly. “You just mix some cream
and sugar and flavoring stuff up and freeze it.
I’ve seen our cook do it lots of times. Here’s
my electric torch. That’ll be handy, you’ll admit.
And here’s a collapsible bucket. It’s great! I
saw it in a store window one day. See how it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
folds up when you aren’t using it? That’s a
box of soap; I knew you fellows would forget to
put soap on your list.”</p>

<p>Neither Dick nor Roy had anything to say;
they <em>had</em> forgotten.</p>

<p>“Those are some books I want to read. Have
you read that one, Roy? It’s a thriller! Take it
along with you. It’ll keep you awake half the
night. These old trousers I thought might come
in handy in case anyone fell in the water.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Roy’s mother. “You
don’t expect to fall overboard do you?”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Porter, but you never can tell what
will happen,” replied Chub, wisely. “Those are
shells for the shot-gun and that’s my fly-book.
I should think we might find some good fishing,
eh? Here’s a ‘first aid’ case. Mother insisted
on my bringing that. I don’t know what’s in it,
but I suppose there’s no harm having it along.
Here are some curtains; I used to have them in
my room until they got faded. I thought maybe
we’d find a place for them. And this is an extra
blanket. I just put it in so that the bottom of the
trunk would be soft. And a hair pillow; it’s
rather soiled, but that’s just shoe-dressing I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
spilled on it once. The laundress couldn’t get
it all out. And I guess that’s all except this
thermometer. Oh, the mischief! The plaguey
thing’s broken! Throw it away. It was just a
cheap one, anyhow. There, that’s the lot. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how we’d have got along without
those things, Chub,” said Roy, very, very
earnestly. “How we could have expected to go
on a cruise without a foot-ball and a hair pillow
and a collapsible bucket—”</p>

<p>“And a pair of old trousers and a thermometer,”
added Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t see. Do you Dick?” Dick shook his
head gravely.</p>

<p>“We must have been crazy,” he said, sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you say what you like!” responded Chub.
“You’ll find that all these things will come in
mighty handy before we get back.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Roy, “even if we have to
load them in another boat and tow it along behind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out; there’s plenty of room for this
truck. You fellows are just jealous because you
didn’t think of them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“I quite approve of the ice-cream freezer,”
remarked Mr. Porter, “but I don’t just see how
you’re going to work it without the dasher.”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” exclaimed Chub. “Didn’t I put that
in?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see it anywhere; do you?”
Then followed a wild search for the dasher.
At last Chub gave it up and looked a trifle
foolish.</p>

<p>“I remember now,” he muttered. “I took it
out of the can so that it wouldn’t rattle around.
I—I must have forgotten to pack it.”</p>

<p>He joined good-naturedly in the laugh that
arose.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” he said presently, “I dare say we
can get along without ice-cream. It’s a bother
to have to freeze it. And maybe we can use the
tub as a bucket and keep something in the can;
we could keep our milk in it.”</p>

<p>“I imagine that most of the milk we’ll have
will come in cans,” said Roy. “You don’t expect
fresh milk, do you?”</p>

<p>“I surely do. We can buy it at the farm-houses.”</p>

<p>“Condensed milk is cheaper, though,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Dick, “because you don’t have to use much sugar
with it.”</p>

<p>“Listen to Dickums!” jeered Chub. “He’s
getting economical!”</p>

<p>It was finally decided to leave the ice-cream
freezer behind, and the bag of salt was donated to
Mrs. Porter “as a slight testimonial of esteem
from the master and crew of the <i>Jolly Roger</i>.”
Then the boys went up to Roy’s room and sat
there very late, planning and discussing.</p>

<p>The next morning found them at the wharf
bright and early, even Chub disdaining for once
what he called his “beauty sleep.” The wharf
belonged to a company in which Mr. Porter was
interested and accommodations for the <i>Jolly
Roger</i> had been gladly accorded. She lay in the
slip looking very clean and neat. The new coat
of paint had worked wonders in her appearance.
Each of the boys had brought a suit case filled
with things, and Chub carried besides the two
camp-stools and a large crimson pillow. And
while they are aboard unloading let us look over
the house-boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption">The boys arrive at the wharf</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84-<br />85]</a></span></p>

<p>At first glance the <i>Jolly Roger</i> looked like a
scow with a little one-story white cottage on top,
and a tiny cupola at one end of that. The hull
was thirty-three feet long and thirteen feet wide
and drew about four feet. There was a bluntly
curving bow and the merest suggestion of a
stern, but had it not been for the white cupola on
top, which was in reality a tiny wheel-house, it
would have been difficult to decide which was the
bow end and which the stern end of the craft.
The hull was painted pea-green to a point just
above the water-line. Beyond that there was a
strip of faded rose-pink, and then a narrow margin
of white. The decks were gray, or had been
at one time, the house and railings were white
and the window and door trimming was green.
So she didn’t lack for color.</p>

<p>Small as the boat was she was well built and, in
spite of having been in use for several years, was
in first-rate condition. It was nothing short of a
miracle that so many rooms and passages and
cubbyholes were to be found on her. Chub, in
commenting on this feature, had said once:</p>

<p>“If you gave this hull to a regular carpenter
and told him to build one room and a closet on it
he’d be distracted. And if he did do it he’d have
the closet sticking out over the water somewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
But just look what a boat-builder does! He makes
three rooms, a kitchen, and an engine compartment,
all sorts of closets and cupboards, puts a
roof garden and a pilot-house on top and runs a
piazza all around it! Why, a fellow I know at
home has a little old launch about twenty feet
long and six feet wide and I’m blessed if he hasn’t
pretty nearly everything inside of her except a
ball-room! I’m blamed if I see how they do it!”</p>

<p>On the <i>Jolly Roger</i>, beginning forward, there
was a living-room nine feet by ten. There were
five one-sash windows in it, two on each side and
one in front. Under the front window and running
from side to side was a broad window-seat
comfortably upholstered and supplied with pillows.
Between two of the windows was a bookcase,
in one corner was a cabinet holding a talking-machine
and records, in the center of the room
was a three-foot round table, and three wicker
chairs were distributed about. Forward, in front
of the window, a tiny spiral stairway of iron led
up into the wheel-house above. It had been decided
that if Harry and her father or mother
joined them, a cot-bed was to be placed in this
room, which, with the window-seat, would give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
accommodations for two persons. The living
room gave into a narrow passage which traversed
the boat. Across the passage at the other end
was a door leading into a little bedroom, nine
feet by five. This held a three-foot brass bedstead,
one chair, and a lavatory. Above the bed
drawers and shelves and a mirror had been built.</p>

<p>Back of the bedroom, opening from the deck,
was the engine-room. The engine was of six
horse-power and a very good one, in spite of Mr.
Cole’s aspersions. The gasolene tank was on the
roof above. The <i>Jolly Roger</i> had a guaranteed
speed of five miles an hour, but the boys soon discovered
that the guaranteed speed and the actual
speed didn’t agree by a whole mile. The engine-room
had no window but was lighted by a deadlight
set in the roof. Beyond the engine-room,
on the other side of the boat, was a tiny kitchen,
or, as the boys preferred to call it, galley. This
opened into the after cabin and was so small that
one person entirely filled it. But in spite of its
size it was a model of convenience. There was an
oil-stove, a sink—you forced water from a tank
under the deck by means of a little nickel-plated
pump—an ice-chest, shelves for dishes, hooks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
overhead for pots and kettles, cupboards underneath
for supplies and a dozen other conveniences.
As Dick said, all you had to do
was to stand in front of the sink and reach for
anything you wanted. There was a window above
the sink and Dick discovered that it was very
handy to throw potato peelings and such things
out of.</p>

<p>The remaining apartment was a room nine by
seven which the owner had used principally to
store his painting materials in. Previously it
had contained only a cupboard, table, chair, and
a small, green chest. But now two cot-beds were
established on opposite sides. There wasn’t
much room left, but it was quite possible to move
around and to reach the galley. This after cabin
opened on to the rear deck, about five feet broad,
from whence a flight of steps led up to the roof,
or, again quoting the boys, the upper deck.</p>

<p>This was one of the best features of the little
craft. It was covered with canvas save where
panes of thick glass gave light to the rooms below,
and was railed all around. Outside the railing
were green wooden boxes for flowers. Last summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
these had been filled with geraniums and periwinkle
and had made a brave showing. And the
boys had decided that they would have them so
again. Stanchions held a striped awning which
covered the entire deck. At the forward end was
the wheel-house, a little six by four compartment
glassed on all sides, in which was a steering
wheel—the boat could also be steered from the
engine-room—various pulls for controlling the
engine, a rack for charts, a clock, and a comfortable
swivel chair. Near the stairs there was a little
cedar tender, but this was usually towed astern.
Stowed away below were some inexpensive rugs
which belonged up here, and three willow chairs
and a willow table. A side ladder led from the
upper deck to the lower so that one could get
quickly from engine-room to wheel-house. Topping
the latter was a short pole for a flag. Such
was the house-boat <i>Jolly Roger</i>, Eaton, master.</p>

<p>“Tell you what I’m going to do,” said Dick,
when they had unloaded their bags and distributed
the contents. “I’m going to try the engine.
We’d better find out as soon as we can
whether she’s going to run.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Roy, anxiously.
“Go monkeying around here among all these
ferry-boats and things?”</p>

<p>But Dick explained that his idea was to keep
the boat tied up. So they looked to their two
lines which ran from bow and stern and Dick
slipped into the engine-room. Presently there
was a mild commotion at the stern of the boat
which gradually increased as Dick advanced the
spark. The lines tightened, but held, and Roy
and Chub joined the engineer.</p>

<p>“How does she go?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“All right,” Dick answered, cheerfully. The
engine was chugging away busily and Dick was
moving about it with his oil-can. “I didn’t have
any trouble starting it. I don’t believe Mr. Cole
knows much about engines.” There was a tone
of superiority in Dick’s voice that caused the
others to smile, recalling, as they did, his own
vast ignorance of the subject less than a year ago.
The summer before Dick had purchased a small
launch and what he now knew of gas engines had
been learned in the short space of a few months’
experience chugging about Ferry Hill in the <i>Pup</i>.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Cole always said he didn’t understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that engine,” answered Roy. “Turn her
off, Dick, or we’ll break away from the dock.”</p>

<p>“Wait till I see how she reverses,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, start her back easy,” Chub cautioned,
glancing anxiously at the lines which held them
to the wharf. So Dick slowed the engine down
and then threw back the clutch. The <i>Jolly Roger</i>
obeyed beautifully, and Dick was finally persuaded
to bring the trial to an end. Then they
went over the boat again.</p>

<p>“If Harry brings her mother with her,” said
Roy, “they’ll have to have this room.” They
were in the forward cabin or living room. “We
can put up a cot along here for Mrs. Emery and
Harry can have the window-seat!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Chub, “but the only
place to wash is in the bedroom. We’ll have to
put a bowl and pitcher in here, and a looking-glass,
too; ladies can’t get along without a looking-glass.”</p>

<p>“If her father comes with her,” said Dick,
“Harry can have the bedroom, Doctor Emery can
sleep in here on the cot and one of us fellows can
have the window-seat. Then the other two can
sleep in the after cabin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’ll we eat our meals?” Roy asked.
They looked at each other in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cole ate in the after cabin,” said Chub,
finally, “but there isn’t room there with those
two cots set up.”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” said Dick. “While we’re alone
we’ll take the cots out of the after cabin and use
it for a dining-room. Roy can have the cot in
here and I’ll sleep on the window-seat. Chub
can have the bedroom; he’s captain, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good scheme,” answered Roy, “but
how about when the others come?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll fix it somehow. Besides, maybe
they won’t come. We haven’t heard a word
from Harry yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, the letter had to be forwarded from
Ferry Hill to her aunt’s, I suppose,” explained
Roy. “We’ll probably hear from her to-day or
to-morrow. Half the time we’ll be tied up to the
shore, any way, and we can easily enough set
that little table on the ground.”</p>

<p>“Maybe there’d be room for it on the rear
deck,” suggested Dick. “Kind of under the
stairs, you know. Let’s go and see.”</p>

<p>A survey of the space showed that the plan was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
quite feasible, especially as Dick volunteered to
sit on the railing.</p>

<p>“There’s another thing we’ll have to have,”
said Chub, “and that’s a place to wash when
Harry’s with us. Suppose we haul that little
green chest out here and put a tin basin on it.
We could bring water from the kitch—the galley.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” laughed Roy, “but why not
use your precious folding bucket and dip the water
out of the river?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” Chub responded.
“That’s a good scheme. We’ll hang it on a nail,
over the basin.”</p>

<p>“Where the mischief are we going to keep
those extra cots when we’re not using them?”
Dick asked.</p>

<p>“I found just the place for them,” Chub replied.
“We’ll lean them up in the passage beyond
the bedroom door and keep the outside door
at that end closed. We don’t need to use it anyway.”</p>

<p>Other problems were solved, and then luncheon,
which they had brought with them, was spread on
the table in the forward cabin and they set to with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a will. Before they had finished the florist appeared
on the scene with geraniums and periwinkle
for the flower boxes. By the time he had
transferred the plants from pots to the boxes
along the edge of the upper deck, he had managed
to mess the new white paint up pretty badly and
the boys spent the better part of half an hour
cleaning up with water and brushes. By that
time it was well toward the middle of the
afternoon and they were quite ready to go
home.</p>

<p>“If we can get the rest of the supplies in to-morrow
morning,” observed Chub as he locked
the last door and slipped the key in his pocket,
“I don’t see why we shouldn’t start to-morrow
after luncheon instead of waiting until the next
morning. We could easily get up the river far
enough to spend the night. What do you
think?”</p>

<p>Both Roy and Dick were quite as eager to get
off as he was, and it was agreed that if the
groceries arrived in time they would begin their
cruise at one o’clock on the morrow. When they
reached Roy’s house they found a letter from
Harry. Roy read it aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Miss Emery accepts with pleasure the kind invitation
of Messrs. Chub, Roy, and Dick, and will be ready to
embark on the <i>Jolly Roger</i> at Ferry Hill at the time
appointed.</p>

<p>P. S. Isn’t it lovely? Mama says I can come home
the 20th and papa will go with me, although he says we
can’t stay with you more than two weeks. But perhaps
you didn’t want us for more than that. Did you? Do
you think I might take Snip along? He will behave
beautifully. Aunt Harriet says I’m certain to be
drowned and wants me to carry a life preserver around
in my hand all the time. Isn’t that funny? She’s
taught me to make pie-crust and so I’ll make you all
the pies you want. Won’t that be fine? I can make
three kinds: apple, cherry, rhubarb. I can make mince,
too, if I have the mincemeat. Don’t forget to write at
once and let me know when you will get to Ferry Hill.
Remembrances to Chub and Dick.</p>

<p class="right">Yours truly, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>.<br /></p>
</div>

<p>“Well, I’m rather glad it’s the Doctor that’s
coming and not Mrs. Emery,” said Dick. “Mrs.
Emery is charming and kind, but a man will be
less trouble. Hello, what’s the matter with you,
Chub?”</p>

<p>Chub was gazing into space with an ecstatic
smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Me?” he asked, coming out of his trance.
“Nothing! I was just thinking of those pies!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE CRUISE BEGINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Behold, then, the <i>Jolly Roger</i> proceeding, as
Chub phrased it, “under her own sail” up
the Hudson River in the middle of a glorious July
afternoon. There was a fresh little breeze quartering
down the river and the surface of the
broad stream was merry with whitecaps. The
long, blue pennant which Dick had discovered in
the wheel-house snapped and waved from the
pole. Chub said he didn’t know what a blue
pennant meant, but that since it looked mighty
well they’d fly it. Roy hoped it wasn’t a demand
for assistance or a token of sickness on
board. They wanted to dip it as they passed
Grant’s tomb, white and stately on the crest of
the hill, but the halyards had got twisted, and
by the time they were righted there was nothing
to salute but a dingy little tugboat.</p>

<p>With both tide and wind against her the house-boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
made slow progress, and Chub was inclined
to be impatient.</p>

<p>“We’ll never get to Ferry Hill this side of
Christmas!” he declared. “I vote we name her
over, and call her the <i>Slow Poke</i>.”</p>

<p>Dick and Roy applauded instantly. Chub was
at the wheel and the others were standing behind
him at the open door of the wheel-house,
ready with suggestions and assistance, Dick having
been dragged away from the engine almost
by main force.</p>

<p>“Fine!” said Dick. “Only she’s got <i>Jolly
Roger</i> painted on her bow.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Chub. “Mr. Cole
said we could do anything we liked with her.
When we get to a town we’ll buy some paint and
rename her.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good name,” laughed Roy. “I wonder
Mr. Cole never thought of it himself.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he did; she’s had all sorts of names;
he said so. Now what’s that little sail-boat trying
to do? If she doesn’t look out she’ll get run
over.” Chub blew the whistle warningly.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get out of her way,” said Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“What for?” asked Chub, haughtily. “Let
her get out of our way.”</p>

<p>“Law requires sailing craft to give way to
dories and such and steamboats to give way to
sail-boats,” responded Dick, knowingly.</p>

<p>“Listen to the Ancient Mariner,” jeered Chub.
But he pulled a lever that slowed down the engine,
and so allowed the sail-boat to bob out of harm’s
way. Chub had a chart spread out in front of
him, and now and then he pointed out the places
along the way with the manner of a discoverer,
though Roy said it seemed more like a ride in
a sight-seeing automobile.</p>

<p>“Manhattanville on our right, gentlemen. On
the left historic Fort Lee.”</p>

<p>“What happened there?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Then how do you know it’s historic?”</p>

<p>“All forts are historic,” answered Chub, loftily.
“Across the river are historic Fort Washington
and historic Fort George.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the next fort is historic Fort Cherry-tree,”
muttered Dick, skeptically. “I don’t see
any forts, anyhow. I’m going down again—”</p>

<p>“To throw more oil on that poor old engine,”
mourned Roy. “Dick, let me remind you that oil
costs money. You’ve already squandered about
a gallon.”</p>

<p>“Get out! We only had a quart to begin with.
I’m not going to put any more oil on, anyway;
I just want to see how she’s working.”</p>

<p>“Dick thinks that if he isn’t sitting beside that
engine holding its hand it’ll get mad and quit
work,” laughed Chub. “Let him go, Roy, for
goodness’ sake!” So Dick climbed over the side
and disappeared into the tiny engine-room to sit
on a camp-stool with a bunch of dirty waste in
his hand and watch the engine fascinatedly.</p>

<p>The departure of the house-boat had been quite
devoid of brilliant features. The groceries and
supplies had been delivered early, suit cases and
other luggage had been brought across town in
a cab, and by noon all was in readiness. The
boys had returned to the house for an early luncheon
and afterward, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs.
Porter and Mr. Somes, had come down to the
sea in two bright red taxicabs. The older folks
had been shown over the boat and had then stood
on the end of the wharf and waved good-by while
the <i>Jolly</i>—pardon me, the <i>Slow Poke</i> had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
warped out of the slip and had started up the
river. But Roy’s parents and Dick’s father had
not been the only spectators, and many and sarcastic
had been the comments from the assembled
wharf hands and loiterers. But the boys hadn’t
cared. They had been far too excited and busy.
The <i>Slow Poke</i> didn’t answer very readily to her
helm, and as a result Chub, gallantly assisted by
Roy, had run into the end of a pier and narrowly
escaped colliding with a lighter.</p>

<p>At four o’clock Chub announced that the <i>Slow
Poke</i> had accomplished about four miles. They
were then off what Chub called “picturesque
Tubby Hook.” Roy had to see the name on the
chart before he would believe in the existence of
any such place.</p>

<p>“What I want to know,” said Dick, who had
again momentarily separated himself from the
engine, “is where we’re going to lie up for the
night.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no hurry,” said Roy. “By six
we ought to be—where, Chub?” Chub did some
lightning calculating.</p>

<p>“At Yonkers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“The mischief! That’s no place to spend the
night,” said Dick, disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Roy asked. “Some folks have
to live there all the year round!”</p>

<p>“We don’t have to stop there,” said Chub.
“We’ll cross the river and find a nice, quiet spot
along the Palisades.”</p>

<p>“And as we’ll have to have some dinner—”</p>

<p>“Supper,” corrected Chub.</p>

<p>“You’d better start about now to get your
hands clean, Dick. I never cared for the flavor
of cylinder oil.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Dick, “I’m in for a lot
of work. When I signed for this trip I didn’t
know I was to be engineer and cook, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you did, Dickums. You knew it, but
you didn’t realize it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you fellows needn’t complain if
you don’t get all your meals on time,” answered
Dick, morosely.</p>

<p>“No, we won’t complain; we’ll simply throw
you overboard. But I think Roy had better take
lessons in engineering so that you can have your
Thursday afternoons off. Dickums, take him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
down with you now and give him his first lesson.”</p>

<p>“I want to steer for a while,” said Roy. But
Chub shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel that I can trust you,” he answered.
“With all these young lives depending on careful
navigation—”</p>

<p>The others howled.</p>

<p>“Considering that you hit everything in sight
when we started out,” said Roy, “you’d better—”
Chub viewed them scowlingly.</p>

<p>“This sounds to me like mutiny,” he muttered.
“Kindly put yourselves in irons.”</p>

<p>Roy spent the next half hour studying “Somes
on the Gas-Engine.” Toward six o’clock the <i>Slow
Poke</i> chugged across to the Jersey shore and
after some discussion a place was selected for
anchorage. There was a break here in the rocky
wall of the Palisades and a little stream meandered
down through a tiny valley. The woods
came closely to the river’s edge, and after getting
the <i>Slow Poke</i> as near shore as her draft would
permit, they carried lines from stern and bow
and made them fast to trees. Then all hands set
to to prepare supper. Chub established himself
on the railing of the after deck and pared potatoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
pausing in his task whenever a boat went up or
down the river.</p>

<p>“Say, Dick,” he called, “you ought to bestir
yourself to-morrow and clean that oil stove. I
can smell it out here.”</p>

<p>“Oil stoves always smell,” answered Dick from
the galley.</p>

<p>“Not if you keep them clean. Maybe it needs
new wicks.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it does. And maybe if you don’t finish
paring those potatoes in the next hour or two
we’ll have them for breakfast instead of supper.”</p>

<p>“I like your cheek,” murmured Chub resuming
his task with a sigh. “I’m fairly working my
hands off out here. What’s that loafer Roy
doing anyhow? Why don’t you put him at
work?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about him. I’ve got him
busy all right,” was the reply. “Say, did we
order any salt, Chub? If we did I can’t find it.”</p>

<p>“Send Roy out here to pare these potatoes and
I’ll look for it,” responded Chub insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“We’ve found it,” called Dick. “Aren’t you
nearly done?”</p>

<p>“Sure; all done; been done for hours.” Chub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
slid off the railing and bore the potatoes indoors
and watched them disappear into the pot of boiling
water. Then he and Roy set the table. As
each of them had his own convictions regarding
the arrangement of knives, forks and spoons there
was some confusion for a while. But half an
hour later, all differences of opinion were forgotten.
Sitting about the table in the tiny after cabin,
they had their first meal on board. Through
the open windows wandered a little evening
breeze which, as Chub poetically remarked, “caressed
their cheeks, flushed with the toil of the
long day.” On one side the shadowed woods
showed, on the other the broad expanse of the
river, deeply golden in the late sunlight.</p>

<p>“It’s a perfect shame,” sighed Chub, “to spoil
such an appetite as this. I feel as though I ought
to keep it and treasure it as something valuable.
Pass the ham, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I guess there’s no doubt about our being in
New Jersey,” muttered Roy, slapping the back
of his neck. “The place is full of mosquitoes.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Chub. “I’ve been wondering
what was getting after me so. I thought it
was the bite of hunger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess it is,” laughed Dick. “The bite of
hungry mosquitoes. Say, they won’t do a thing
to us to-night. Let’s move on.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, we’ve got to get used to them sometime
and we might as well start now. Mosquitoes
don’t pay any attention to you after a while.
Where’s the bread gone to?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know, Chub,” replied Dick, rising
to cut a fresh supply.</p>

<p>“It’s a funny thing about mosquitoes,” continued
Chub, helping himself to half a slice of
bread which Roy had left unguarded. “Just you
let them bite you a day or two and they get tired
of you. I suppose they like a change of diet the
same as the rest of us. Is there any more of
the excellent tea, Dickums?”</p>

<p>Presently Chub pushed back his chair with a
sigh of contentment.</p>

<p>“Come on, Roy,” he said. “Let us go up and
sit on deck and watch the pageant of Nature while
the hireling cleans up the dishes.”</p>

<p>“No you don’t!” retorted the hireling. “You
and Roy will stay right here and help. You
needn’t think I’m going to do everything on this
blooming boat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“That smacks of mutiny, methinks,” said Chub.
“What do you say, Roy? Still, I’ll stay and add
my feeble assistance. I choose to wipe the
dishes.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were sitting on the
upper deck, their feet on the railing, feeling very
much at peace with the world. To be sure, the
mosquitoes were somewhat troublesome, but they
strove to take Chub’s advice and bear the annoyance
philosophically. A white light hung from
the flag-pole above the wheel-house and from the
after cabin a feeble glow spread itself over the
water. They had left a lighted lamp there to fool
the mosquitoes.</p>

<p>“They’ll think we’re going to sleep in there,”
explained Chub. “And after they’re all on hand,
sharpening their bills, we’ll sneak down and
close the door.”</p>

<p>“And lock it,” counseled Roy.</p>

<p>“And stuff up the keyhole,” added Dick.
“Only thing I’m afraid of, though, is that they’ll
eat up all the provisions.”</p>

<p>But after a while Chub was obliged to acknowledge
that his plan wasn’t proving entirely
successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess some of these mosquitoes haven’t seen
that light,” he muttered, waving his hands about
his head. “Suppose you run down and turn up
the lamp, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t venture in there among all those
angry mosquitoes for the world!” answered Dick.
“They’d just simply tear me to pieces. I wish I
had some pennyroyal.”</p>

<p>“I wish you had,” Roy agreed. “I’d borrow
some. I wonder why mosquitoes always go for
a fellow’s ankles.”</p>

<p>“They go for the biggest things they see,” explained
Chub, “which, of course, are your feet.
As they can’t bite through leather they tackle
your ankles. They never trouble my ankles.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose they go for your <em>cheek</em>,” retorted
Roy. “What are you rubbing your ankles
together for, if they don’t bite them?”</p>

<p>“Er—one of my feet is asleep.”</p>

<p>“So am I—almost,” said Dick, drowsily.
“What time is it?”</p>

<p>“About half past eight,” said Roy. “What
time do we have breakfast?”</p>

<p>“At eight, sharp,” answered Dick, yawning.</p>

<p>“That means getting up at seven,” murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Chub. “Then I must go to bed at once or I shan’t
have half enough sleep.”</p>

<p>“Being on the river certainly does make a fellow
sleepy,” laughed Roy. “I suppose we’ll get
used to it after a day or two, though.”</p>

<p>“Like the mosquitoes,” said Dick. “I wish I
could believe that tale of Chub’s; it would help
me to bear my present troubles with more—more—”</p>

<p>“Equanimity,” said Chub, helpfully. “It’s a
scientific fact, though, Dickums. Why, after a
week or so—”</p>

<p>“You said a day or two!”</p>

<p>“Or thereabouts, the mosquitoes simply won’t
look at you. They won’t touch you even if you
go down on your knees and beg ’em to!”</p>

<p>“I have a funny picture of myself doing it!”
growled Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t approve of these low expressions you
use,” said Chub regretfully. “I suppose you
learn them at school. You should choose your
companions very carefully, Dickums.”</p>

<p>“I have since you fellows left,” answered Dick
with a grin.</p>

<p>For a while the conversation turned to Ferry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Hill and the fellows there, but as each of the
three evinced an inclination to fall asleep in the
middle of a sentence, the talk wasn’t very brilliant
or interesting. Finally, Roy dropped his
feet with a thud from the railing and stood up.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, calmly.</p>

<p>“Eh? What?” asked Chub, with a start.</p>

<p>“They’ve completed the circuit.”</p>

<p>“Circuit? What circuit? Who’s completed—”</p>

<p>“The mosquitoes have completed the circuit of
my ankles. They have been around both and I
am now going to bed. I’ve done my duty by
them.” Roy stood on one foot and rubbed busily
with the other.</p>

<p>“How nice,” murmured Chub. “Something
accomplished, something done to earn a night’s
repose. That’s me too. Let us go quietly and
leave Dick to slumber peacefully on.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘The yawning youth, scarce half awake, essays<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His lazy limbs and dozy head to raise,’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">observed Dick.</p>

<p>“Hello! I thought you were asleep!” said
Chub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was until some noisy brute awoke me,”
complained Dick.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get the poetry?” Roy asked.</p>

<p>“That? I don’t just recall,” replied Dick
sleepily. “I think I composed it myself. It was
either I or Dryden.”</p>

<p>They stumbled down the steps to the lower
deck, Chub begging them to go softly so as not
to attract the attention of the mosquitoes in the
after cabin, and sought their beds. Chub had the
bedroom and the others shared the living-room,
Roy using a cot and Dick the window-seat.</p>

<p>“Is everything all right for the night?” yawned
Roy.</p>

<p>“I think so,” replied Chub from across the
little passage. “I don’t know just what you do
on a house-boat when you go to bed.”</p>

<p>“You lock the front door, fix the furnace, and
turn down the gas in the front hall,” murmured
Dick.</p>

<p>Sleepy as they were, slumber didn’t come to
them at once. It was all rather new as yet.</p>

<p>“How’s your divan, Dickums?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“Fine! I like a hard bed. How’s yours?”</p>

<p>“Great! Good-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-night. Oh, I say!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Got any mosquitoes where you are?”</p>

<p>“Have I. Plenty! Want some?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.” A few minutes later,</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, you fellows,” called Chub,
“what’s all that squeaking in there?”</p>

<p>“It’s my bed,” answered Roy. “It squeaks
every time I turn over.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t turn over then,” grumbled Chub.</p>

<p>And finally, just when Dick and Roy were on
the borderland of slumber, Chub’s voice floated
across again.</p>

<p>“Say, Dick!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Did you let the cat in?”</p>

<p>Then there was peace and silence save for the
contented, humming of the mosquitoes.</p>

<p class="cap">The next day after breakfast was over the <i>Slow
Poke</i> took up her journey again. It had
been decided that the proper thing to do was to
get up the river to the neighborhood of Peekskill
where, according to Roy, there was fishing to
be had. “Besides,” said Chub, “we want to get
away from all these towns. Civilization is wearying.
I pine for the virgin forest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’ll find much of that around
Peekskill,” responded Dick. “Look at the
map!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t believe all you see on the
map,” answered Chub, cheerfully. “Something
tells me—” placing a finger on the chart—“that
here I shall find virgin forest. Also trout. Let
us up and away.”</p>

<p>They chugged unhurriedly up the river all the
morning, the engine much to Dick’s delight, working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
beautifully. At noon they tied up near Ossining
and had dinner.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to travel on that,” said Chub, pointing
with his fork to a steamer which was gliding
by out in the river. “It goes so fast those people
can’t begin to see the beauties of the country.
Now with us it’s different. We catch sight of
an object of interest at ten in the morning. At
eleven we approach it. At twelve we reach it.
At one we are by but still have it in plain sight.
It fades from view at four in the afternoon.
That’s something like. We have time to study
and—er—assimilate, you see. Why, every feature
of the landscape we have passed is indelibly
engraven on my memory.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now,” laughed Roy, “the <i>Slow Poke</i>
hasn’t done so badly. We’ve come a good thirteen
miles since breakfast.”</p>

<p>“What I’m afraid of,” said Dick, “is that if
we keep on going like this we’ll be at the end of
the river before we know it. How much more
is there?”</p>

<p>“Only about two hundred and twenty-five
miles,” replied Roy, dryly. “If we keep on at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the present rate of progress we’ll reach the end
of it in about eleven days—if we don’t stop on the
way.” Dick looked relieved.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right, then. Because we are
going to stop, of course.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to do more stopping than anything
else,” said Chub. “House-boats are intended
primarily to stop in. As—as vehicles of
travel they are not to be taken seriously.”</p>

<p>“My!” murmured Dick, “what a college education
does do for a fellow!”</p>

<p>“English A is a great course,” agreed Roy,
smilingly. “You’ll be so happy next year with
your little daily themes, Dick!”</p>

<p>Dick groaned.</p>

<p>They wandered on again in the afternoon, Roy
taking another lesson on the gas-engine, and
stopped for the night in a little cove on the east
side near Cortlandt. As it still lacked almost an
hour of supper-time, they left the boat to stretch
their legs on shore. They found a road and
tramped along it for a quarter of an hour without
finding anything more interesting than a farm-house.
But the farm-house put an idea into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Chub’s head. He stopped at the gate and
pointed.</p>

<p>“Milk,” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we didn’t bring anything to put it
in,” Roy objected.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. They’ll lend us a can,
maybe. Come on.”</p>

<p>So they trudged up the long lane and knocked
on the front door. Receiving no answer after
a decent interval of waiting, they proceeded
around back. At a little distance stood a big
barn. Near-by was a well with a number of big
milk cans beside it.</p>

<p>“There you are,” said Chub. “Maybe they’ll
lend us one of those. Come on.”</p>

<p>The back door was open and from the little
covered porch they had a glimpse of a very clean
and tidy kitchen. Chub knocked. There was no
answer.</p>

<p>“All out, it seems,” he muttered. He knocked
again and then raised his voice. “Any one at
home?” he asked.</p>

<p>There was. A big, rough-coated yellow dog
bounded across the yard, the hair along his back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
bristling unpleasantly. His onslaught was so
sudden and fierce that Dick, who saw him first,
was the first one inside the door. But Chub and
Roy were tied for second place, and the dog—well,
the dog would have made a good third if
Roy hadn’t had the presence of mind to slam the
door a few inches in front of his nose.</p>

<p>“I say!” gasped Chub. “Did you see him?
Isn’t he an ugly brute?”</p>

<p>“He certainly is,” agreed Dick, with an uneasy
laugh. “Hear him, will you?”</p>

<p>The dog was growling savagely and sniffing
along the bottom of the door.</p>

<p>“Nice doggie,” called Chub, soothingly. “Nice
doggie! Go away, Rover!”</p>

<p>“Try ‘Prince,’” Roy suggested.</p>

<p>“Try it yourself! I wonder if there’s any one
in here. You fellows look after the door and I’ll
go and see.”</p>

<p>Chub walked through the kitchen into a little
narrow entry and called loudly. But there was
no answer.</p>

<p>He returned to the others.</p>

<p>“Still there?” he asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” muttered Roy. “I don’t hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
anything. Maybe he’s gone. Can you see from
the window?”</p>

<p>Chub walked over to the nearest casement and
looked out.</p>

<p>“He’s lying on the porch with his nose about
half an inch from the door,” he reported, disgustedly.
“He’s a Saint Bernard, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what he is,” said Roy. “He’s a
nuisance. What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Put your head out of the window and yell,”
suggested Dick. “They’re probably in the
barn.”</p>

<p>“All right, but not that window,” Chub
answered. He went to the farther side of the
kitchen, raised the window there and yelled loudly.</p>

<p>“Hello! You in the barn! Call off your dog!
Hello! Hello!”</p>

<p>But the dog started such a barking that Chub’s
efforts were quite wasted.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’ll just have to make ourselves
comfortable and wait for Mr. Farmer to come
back,” he said, closing the window again.</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” said Dick, in a hoarse whisper.
“We’ll get out the front door. If we close
it quietly he won’t hear us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>They looked at each other doubtfully. The
plan didn’t seem to awaken much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Roy, “but if he did
hear us—”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’d actually attack us,” said
Dick.</p>

<p>“It didn’t look like it, did it?” asked Chub,
sarcastically. “Oh, no, he’s a nice little playful
pet, he is.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t stay here all night,” said Dick.
“And for all we know there may not be anybody
in the barn.”</p>

<p>“Of course there is! Do you think they’d go
away and leave the back of the house all open
like this?”</p>

<p>“Well, with that animal out there I guess
they’d be safe to put the family silver on the
front piazza,” retorted Roy. “But I guess
there’s some one around somewhere. There’s
a fire in the stove and that looks as though they
meant to get supper.” The mention of supper
brought back Chub’s valor.</p>

<p>“Well, come on, and let’s try the front-door
trick. Go easy, fellows.”</p>

<p>They tiptoed across the kitchen, through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
entry, and reached the front door only to find
that it was locked and that there was no key in
sight.</p>

<p>“Sometimes they hang it on a nail alongside
the door,” muttered Chub, running his hand
around the frame.</p>

<p>“Or put it under the mat,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any mat. Let’s try a window.
Come on in here.”</p>

<p>He led the way into a dim and deserted parlor,
a stuffy, uncanny apartment in which the curtains
were closely drawn at the three windows.</p>

<p>“See if you can see Fido,” counseled Chub.
Roy raised the shade at one of the windows on the
front of the house and looked out. Beneath was
a bed of purple phlox and beyond was a walk and
a little space of grass. At the right was the
lane—and safety.</p>

<p>“He isn’t in sight,” Roy answered in whispers.
“But he may come.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter,” answered Chub, recklessly.
“I want to go home to supper. Push up
the window.”</p>

<p>Roy obeyed. The sash creaked and screamed
as he forced it up and they paused and held their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
breath, expecting to see the dog come bounding
into sight. But nothing happened.</p>

<p>“You go first, Roy,” said Chub. “Dick and
I can run faster than you.”</p>

<p>“Want me to have the first bite, eh?” laughed
Roy, as he put a knee over the sill.</p>

<p>“Be quiet! Don’t make so much noise,” said
Chub. “Get on out.”</p>

<p>Roy was sitting on the sill, his feet dangling
above the flower bed.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he muttered, “but—say,
Dick, go back and take a peek out of the window
and see if he’s still there.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Dick tiptoed back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Chub, “that I should want
the family to walk in now and discover us. We
might have some difficulty in—<em>Hello!</em>”</p>

<p>He darted away from the window, leaving Roy
blankly confronting a very tall man with a tangled
black beard, who had suddenly and noiselessly
come around the corner of the house. He wore
dirty brown jumpers, carried a single barreled
shot-gun, and wasn’t at all prepossessing. And
beside him, still growling and bristling, was the
yellow dog. <a href="#i_p123">Roy stared silently with open mouth.</a></p>

<p class="cap">The farmer smiled, but it wasn’t a pleasant
smile, and it exposed half a dozen yellow
fanglike teeth that made Roy wonder whether
there could be any relationship between the dog
and his master.</p>

<p>“Tell the other feller to come back,” said the
farmer. “I seen him.”</p>

<p>“You mean you saw me,” murmured Chub,
stepping into sight behind Roy.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the farmer, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” asked Chub, affably.</p>

<p>“You’ll see how I do and <em>what</em> I do,” was the
grim reply. “What you doing in my house?”</p>

<p>“We—we were just getting out,” answered
Roy, with a sickly smile which was intended to be
propitiating.</p>

<p>“With your pockets full, I guess. You stay
where you are, understand?” He brought the
shot-gun up and laid it over his arm in a suggestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
way that made Roy wish his legs were
inside the window rather than out.</p>

<p>“If you mean that we’ve been stealing anything,”
said Chub tartly, “you’re making a mistake.
We came up here to buy some milk and
your fool dog ran at us and drove us into the
house. And here we are. If you’ll take him out
of the way we’ll get out.”</p>

<p>“Guess you will,” chuckled the farmer.
“Guess you’d be pretty glad to. But you won’t,
understand? You get on back into that room.”
This to Roy in a threatening growl that fairly
lifted the boy’s legs over the sill and deposited
them on the parlor carpet. “And you stay there
till I come, understand? Watch ’em, Carlo!”</p>

<p>Carlo growled and looked longingly at the boys.
The farmer tucked the shot-gun under his arm
and disappeared around the corner of the house.
Roy and Chub looked at each other in comical
dismay.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t this beat the Dutch?” asked Chub.
“Say, where’s Dick? I’ll wager he heard the
old codger coming and has hidden. What are we
going to do, Roy?”</p>

<p>“Tell the truth. He hasn’t any business to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
keep us in here. If it hadn’t been for his old
dog—”</p>

<p>The farmer’s footsteps sounded in the entry
and he entered the room, his shot-gun still under
his arm. He looked around suspiciously, as
though expecting to find the marble-topped center
table and the cottage organ missing, and cast
shrewd glances at the boy’s pockets.</p>

<p>“Well, you see we haven’t stolen anything,”
said Chub.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t taking your word for it,” said
the farmer, dryly. “Maybe if I hadn’t come
when I did—”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t be unreasonable,” begged Chub.
“I’ve told you how we came to be here. We
were passing along the road and wanted some
milk—”</p>

<p>“Thought you’d find it in the parlor, did ye?”</p>

<p>“No, but your dog chased us in the back door
and we couldn’t make any one hear by shouting—”</p>

<p>“You shouted pretty loud, didn’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” answered Chub, defiantly, “but
that idiotic dog made such a row with his barking
that you couldn’t hear me. So then we came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in here to get out the window, because the front
door was locked. Now you know; and as we’re
already late for supper, perhaps you’ll call off
that fool dog and let us go home.”</p>

<p>“Want to go, do ye?” asked their captor with
a leer.</p>

<p>“Yes, we do,” replied Chub, shortly.</p>

<p>“Live right round here, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“You can suppose anything you want to,”
broke in Roy, hotly. “But we won’t tell you
where we live. It’s none of your business and
if you don’t let us out of here this minute we’ll
make trouble for you.”</p>

<p>“’Course you will,” said the farmer with a
chuckle. “Go to town, likely, and swear out a
warrant for me, eh? How’d you know I was
alone here? How’d you know my wife was
away?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know anything about your wife!”</p>

<p>“Some one told you, eh?”</p>

<p>“I tell you we never heard of you before—”</p>

<p>“And don’t want to again,” murmured Chub.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t know about Carlo, did ye? I
bought Carlo after you was here last month.
He’s a good dog and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“After we were here last month?” repeated
Chub. “Great Scott, we’ve never seen your old
farm before in our lives. We got here an hour
ago in our boat—”</p>

<p>“Travel in your private yacht, do ye? Left it
down at the gate, I suppose?” The farmer chuckled
enjoyably.</p>

<p>“She’s tied up in the cove about a half mile
below here,” said Chub, angrily. “If you don’t
believe it, you can come along and see her for
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Dare say, dare say. What you got in your
pockets?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that belongs to you!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen anything worth stealing,”
added Roy wrathfully.</p>

<p>“You haven’t, eh?” snarled the man. “Took
it all last time, eh? Looking for more silverware,
I guess. Wan’t satisfied with what you had.
Should have been, eh? Made a mistake, didn’t
ye? Made a mistake coming back to the same
place, eh? Thought Jim Ewing was fool enough
to be caught twice at the same game, eh? Huh!”
he paused and looked at them triumphantly.
“More fools you, then. And you look sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
enough, too. Wouldn’t have thought you’d have
been such fools.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the matter with you,” growled
Chub, exasperatedly.</p>

<p>“Well, you march along up-stairs now, and
you’ll see. Go along, and don’t make any trouble
or—” he patted the shot-gun—“this thing might
go off. That’d be a clear case of justifiable homicide,
eh?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll just put that down a minute,” said
Chub, yearningly, “I’ll—I’ll—”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t; I’m a peaceable citizen, I am.
Don’t say it wouldn’t be some satisfaction to wallop
you, but I’ll leave it to the law. Go on up,
now.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Roy, choking his anger,
“what do you intend to do with us?”</p>

<p>“Want to know, do you? You walk up-stairs,
or—” he brought the ancient shot-gun to the position
of “charge.” Chub and Roy cast anxious
glances at each other. Then, with a shrug, Chub
turned, crossed the room, and mounted the staircase,
followed by Roy and Mr. Ewing.</p>

<p>“Turn to the left at the top,” called the latter.
“You’ll be real comfortable while I’m gone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
you won’t find anything to tempt you to steal.
That’s it. Sit down, boys, and make yourselves
to home. I won’t be gone more’n an hour if I can
help it. Don’t be lonesome.” He closed the door
and turned the key in the lock, and they heard him
go off down-stairs chuckling.</p>

<p>“I’d like to—to—!” But words failed him,
and Roy dropped on the old-fashioned bed and
stared savagely about the little room.</p>

<p>“So would I,” said Chub, grimly, thrusting his
hands in his pockets and walking across to the
single narrow window through which the late sunlight
slanted. When he turned again to Roy,
there was a smile on his face. “Isn’t this the
greatest pickle, Roy? He thinks we’re a couple
of hardened criminals; thinks we have been here
before.” He laughed softly. “I’ve never been
in jail yet. I wonder how it feels.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see where the fun comes in,” answered
Roy. “We may have a dickens of a time convincing
folks that we didn’t come here to steal his
things. Where do you suppose Dick got to?”</p>

<p>“Blest if I know. Maybe he saw the old chap
coming across from the barn and hid himself.
Maybe he managed to get out the back door while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the old fellow was round front. If he did—”</p>

<p>“He’s coming back,” muttered Roy. “And
he’s bringing that beast of a dog.”</p>

<p>“You stay here and watch, Carlo,” said the
farmer outside the door. “Don’t let ’em out,
sir!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ewing!” called Roy.</p>

<p>“Well? I hear ye.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you believe what we tell you? That
we had no intention of robbing your house.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you waste your breath on me, young
man. Keep them yarns for the police. I won’t
keep you waiting longer’n I can help. You’d
better not try to get out; it wouldn’t be good for
you; Carlo’s got a sort of a mean disposition, he
has.”</p>

<p>“So have you,” cried Chub. “You’ve got the
upperhand now, but just you wait till I get out of
here! I’ll make you wish you had a grain or two
of common-sense; hear?”</p>

<p>“I hear ye,” muttered the farmer, “I hear ye.
I guess what you fellers need is a few years in
jail, and, by gum, you’re going to get it! Watch
’em, Carlo!”</p>

<p>They heard him go stumping down-stairs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
out of the house at the back. Roy went to the window
and after much grunting, managed to open
the lower sash. Chub joined him.</p>

<p>“We can’t get out here, that’s certain,” he
said. “It’s thirty feet to the ground if it’s an
inch. Look at the old fool!”</p>

<p>Mr. Ewing was in plain sight in front of the
barn. He had run a rickety side-bar buggy out of
the carriage shed, and now he entered the barn
again.</p>

<p>“He’s going to town for a constable,” mused
Roy. “I wonder how far it is.”</p>

<p>“He said he wouldn’t be more than an hour.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got an hour to find a way out of
here.” Roy turned and looked frowningly about
the room. It was some twelve by fifteen feet in
size, with one door into the hall, and one window.
The walls were kalsomined a streaky white. The
furnishings consisted of a bed and a mattress, a
yellow bureau, a chair, and a wash-stand with
bowl and pitcher and a square of rag carpet.</p>

<p>“If we only had some bedclothes,” muttered
Roy.</p>

<p>“Or a ladder,” added Chub with a grin. “I
guess we’re here to stay unless—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Unless Dick turns up. I don’t believe he’s
gone off very far, do you?” Roy’s reply was interrupted
by the clatter of wheels and they went
back to the window in time to see Mr. Ewing rattle
by in the buggy. He looked up and grinned
malevolently at the faces in the window.</p>

<p>Roy waved down to him airily. “Good-by,
Pop!” he called.</p>

<p>The farmer cut the horse savagely with the
whip and was out of sight around the corner of
the house.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it does any good to sass him,”
said Chub, “but it gives me a lot of satisfaction.”
He went over and kicked the door and was rewarded
with a deep growl from Carlo. “Dear
little doggie is still at his post,” he said. He bent
and put his mouth to the key-hole. “Carlo,” he
called softly, “dear little dogums! I’d like to
wring your blooming neck, do you hear? You do
hear? Well, think about it, will you?” He
walked back to the window, whistling cheerfully.
Roy, seated on the edge of the bed, scowled.</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass,” he said, grumpily.</p>

<p>“Why not? What’s the use of making a tragedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
out of it? Let us dance, sing, and be merry!
‘We’re here because we’re here, because we’re
here, because we’re here!’” Chub sang the
words to the tune of Auld Lang Syne.</p>

<p>Roy smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“Let us play we’re Monte Cristos,” said Chub.
“What was it he did when he was shut up in the
Castle of Thingamabob? Dug his way through
the wall, didn’t he? Well, let’s do the same!”
Chub drew out his pocket-knife and began to hack
at the plaster.</p>

<p>“If you do that,” observed Roy, “they’ll give
us ten days in jail for destroying property, or
vandalism, or disturbing the peace, or something.”</p>

<p>“That’s so! I don’t see but they’ve got us
anyway,” said Chub. “We might as well be hung
for a lamb as a—no, for a sheep as a lamb, as the
old saying goes. What’s that?” He stopped
and listened. Then he ran to the window and
looked cautiously out. Below, at the edge of the
lane, stood Dick, his hands in his pockets, grinning
up at the window.</p>

<p>“Hello, Chub!” he called. “Come on out!”</p>

<p>“Mother won’t let me,” answered Chub, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a grin. “Where were you Dickums, when the
storm broke?”</p>

<p>“In the preserves.”</p>

<p>“In the what?”</p>

<p>“Preserve closet under the stairs. I heard
everything nicely. I thought I’d die!”</p>

<p>“Did, did you?” asked Roy, sarcastically.
“You always did have a crazy sense of humor.
What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Me? Go back to the boat and have supper,
of course,” replied Dick, with a wicked grin.
“It’s a fine night, isn’t it? See the new moon?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a ninny,” said Roy, impatiently.
“Do something! He may be back any moment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he’s good for an hour; he said so.
What’ll I do—shoot the dog or burn the house
down?”</p>

<p>“Find a ladder, you blathering idiot,” Chub
laughed. “There ought to be one at the barn.”</p>

<p>“There is. I looked.”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you bring it?”</p>

<p>“It’s too short.”</p>

<p>There was silence after this for a moment.
Then,</p>

<p>“How much too short?” asked Roy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“About ten feet, I guess.”</p>

<p>“You guess! Well, go get it and let’s find
out!”</p>

<p>“Instantly, your Majesty!” Dick went off toward
the barn unhurriedly, whistling softly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he exasperating?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“We’ll square up with him when we get
down,” answered Chub with a grim smile of anticipation.
In two or three minutes Dick was
back, dragging the ladder after him. He placed
it against the house under the window and they
viewed the result. It lacked at least ten feet of
reaching the sill.</p>

<p>“That’s no good,” said Chub. “Isn’t there a
longer one anywhere? Have you looked?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Exalted One.”</p>

<p>“I say, don’t be so funny! Do you think we
want to be arrested for burglary and have to
spend the night in jail? Can’t you think of anything?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it? Now, don’t you crack any
more funny jokes or we’ll make you sorry when
we get down.”</p>

<p>Dick looked up speculatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe you have some such idea in your head
already?” he asked. “I believe you have. Now
before I go on with this heroic rescue you’ve got
to agree, both of you, to let me laugh as much as I
like. Do you agree?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Honest Injun?”</p>

<p>“Honest Injun, Dickums. Go ahead, like a
good fellow, and get us out of here.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ve got a piece of rope here;
see?” He took it from under his coat and held
it up. “I’ll tie this to the top of the ladder and
throw it up to you. Then you haul the ladder up
and make the rope fast to something in the room.
That’ll leave the ladder only about ten feet from
the ground. You can drop that distance easily.”</p>

<p>“Good old Dickums! You’re the right sort.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>A NEW ACQUAINTANCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was a beautiful evening. In the west the sunset
glow still hung above the hills. Eastward
the full moon’s great, golden disk was poised
against the darkening blue of the summer sky.
It was very still and quiet, and the only sounds
that came to them were the soft <em>pat-pat</em> of their
shoes on the dusty road. When half the distance
to the house-boat had been covered they slowed
down to a walk, panting and puffing.</p>

<p>“What—are we going—to do—when we get—there?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Have some supper,” said Chub, decisively.</p>

<p>“But we can’t stay where we are. When he
finds that we’ve skipped out, he will be as mad
as a hornet and will come down here looking for
us.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, I don’t think he believed a word we
said about being in a boat,” said Chub. “Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
he’s just as likely to look up the river as
down.”</p>

<p>“And just as likely to look down as up,” replied
Roy. “I guess Dick’s right we’d better
move on.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, we will; just as soon as we’ve
had something to eat,” agreed Chub.</p>

<p>“If we wait for that our supper is likely to consist
of bread and water,” answered Roy, dryly.
“What we want to do is to get across to the other
side of the river. I never thought I’d be glad to
get to New Jersey, but the time has come.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t Jersey over there, it’s New
York,” said Chub.</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s a heap better than the calaboose,”
laughed Dick. “Was that wheels I
heard?”</p>

<p>They stopped and listened, but the only sound
that reached them was the distant barking of a
dog.</p>

<p>“Carlo!” said Chub.</p>

<p>“Get out! It’s the wrong direction. Come on
and let’s get back. I had no idea we’d gone as
far as we have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Dick. “And what’s more I don’t
believe we have!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Chub, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I mean that we’ve gone by the boat.” They
stopped and looked about them in the twilight.
Chub thrust his cap back and rubbed his forehead
reflectively.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” he said. “All I remember
is that we came through a strip of woods,
and it’s woods all along on this side. We’d better
strike through them here and see if we can
see the boat.”</p>

<p>Much subdued they followed him between the
trees and bushes. After a minute or two of slow
progress they came to a narrow field.</p>

<p>“I never saw this before,” growled Roy.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any field here an hour ago,”
agreed Dick.</p>

<p>“I’d just like to know,” muttered Chub, “how
it got here. Someone’s been taking liberties with
the landscape.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” remarked Roy, “that we’re
just lost.”</p>

<p>“Well come on. The river’s down here somewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Once we get to that all we’ve got to do is
to follow it till we find the <i>Jolly</i>—find the <i>Slow
Poke</i>,” said Dick, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“And which way shall we walk, upstream or
down?” Chub inquired. Dick looked a trifle crestfallen
for an instant. Then,</p>

<p>“We can decide that when we get there,” he
said. “Anyhow, don’t let’s spend the night here.
I’m as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>“Hungry!” muttered Chub, bitterly. “So am
I! Well, come along.”</p>

<p>They crossed the field, a particularly moist and
“squashy” one, and entered more woods. By this
time, although it was still light enough in the
open, it was difficult to see much in the forest, and
they stumbled over stumps and wandered into
blackberry thickets every few steps.</p>

<p>“A chap needs a suit of chain armor for this
sort of thing,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“‘This is the forest primeval,’” murmured
Chub, picking himself out of a bush. “It’s evil,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” cried Dick, who had found fewer
pitfalls and had taken the lead. “Here it is!”</p>

<p>“The boat?” asked Roy, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, the river.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” they joined him and found themselves
on the shore of a little cove, but it was shallower
than the one they had left the boat in and was
quite empty of craft. Chub sat down on a rock
and sighed.</p>

<p>“How beautiful is Nature!” he murmured.</p>

<p>“I’ll swap my interest in it for a cup of coffee
and a slice of bread,” answered Dick, morosely.
“I’m going to see if I can find the boat.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go,” begged Chub. “Sit here beside
me on this downy couch and let us view the prospect
o’er.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager we’re too far down the river,”
said Roy, inattentively. “Let’s go that way.
From that point there we ought to be able to see
the boat.”</p>

<p>“Lead on,” cried Chub. “We place ourselves
in your hands.”</p>

<p>They skirted the cove and reached the point,
but although from there they could see several
hundred yards up the shore, there was no sight of
either another cove or the <i>Slow Poke</i>.</p>

<p>“I guess we’re too far upstream, after all,”
said Roy. “Let’s look the other way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m thankful the river doesn’t run east and
west as well,” said Chub. “’Tis a merry life we
lead.”</p>

<p>Back they went to the cove and around that to
another point. But below there the shore wound
in and out confusedly, and, even had the <i>Slow
Poke</i> lain fifty yards away from them, it was now
so dark that it is doubtful if they could have discerned
her.</p>

<p>“Let us lie down here quietly and die,” suggested
Chub.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t fool,” said Roy. “Come on.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, fellows!” this from Dick.
“Come to think of it, when we got out onto the
road this afternoon there was a sign on the fence,
don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” cried Chub. “‘Noble’s Chill and Fever
Compound;’ we spoke of it! That’s easy;
all we’ve got to do is to get back to the road and
find the sign.”</p>

<p>“For all we know there may be one every fifty
feet,” said Roy, pessimistically. “However,
we’ll try it.”</p>

<p>Getting back to the road was no simple matter,
though. The woods were pitch dark now, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
field beyond was not much lighter, while to make
matters worse they crossed the latter where it
was little better than a swamp, and at every step
their shoes went <em>squash</em>, <em>squash</em> in the yielding
turf. But they were soon across it and in the
gloom of the farther woods.</p>

<p>“Courage, mon braves,” said Chub. “It is
soon over.”</p>

<p>But Chub was wrong, for they stumbled on and
on, through bushes and briars, and still no road
appeared out of the darkness.</p>

<p>“This is funny,” panted Dick, pausing to disentangle
himself from the affectionate embrace
of a vine. “We ought to have reached the road
long ago.”</p>

<p>“It is the enchanted forest,” replied Chub.
“Have you never read of the enchanted forest?”</p>

<p>“We’ve been keeping too far to the right,”
said Roy, thoughtfully. “Let’s try it off this
way.”</p>

<p>“By all means!” Chub bumped into a tree,
drew back to murmur politely, “I beg your pardon,
madam,” and followed.</p>

<p>“If I ever find that road,” said Dick, savagely,
“you can be sure I’m going to stay on it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is a road,” said Chub.</p>

<p>“I’m going to find one if I have to walk all
night,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“That’s what you think,” replied Chub, sadly.
“But you’re in the enchanted forest, I tell you.
We’re Little <i>Nemos</i>, that’s what we are!”</p>

<p>But the next moment the darkness gave place
to twilight and they stumbled down a little bank
to the dusty road. With one accord they threw
themselves down on the grass.</p>

<p>“Here’s where I stay until morning,” sighed
Dick.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a sign over there?” Roy asked.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” muttered Chub, “but I’ve got so I
don’t believe in signs.” Roy, however, had
crossed the road and was trying to decipher the
words on the panel nailed to the fence. Finally
he lighted a match and,</p>

<p>“‘Noble’s Chill and Fever Compound,’” he
read, “‘safe and certain. Ask your druggist.’”</p>

<p>“‘Ask your druggist,’” sneered Dick. “I’d
like to have the chance to ask a druggist! I
wouldn’t ask for that, though; I’d ask for a chocolate,
or an egg-and-milk.”</p>

<p>“I suppose those things are stuck all along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
road,” said Roy, throwing himself down again
on the bank. “We know that that one isn’t the
one we saw before.”</p>

<p>“Maybe if we sit here much longer,” said
Chub, “we’ll be glad to know of a good remedy
for chills and fever. I’m going on.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Anywhere! What matters it? If we walk
long enough we’ll come to a village. And once
in a village if I don’t get my hands on a sandwich
and a cup of coffee it’s a wonder!”</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Dick, “which way shall we
go?”</p>

<p>“South,” answered Chub. “I saw a sort of a
village a mile or so before we stopped this afternoon.
Come on, fellows; never say die!”</p>

<p>“Maybe we will come across a house pretty
soon,” said Roy. “If we do let’s ask for something
to eat and a bed in the barn.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they have beds in the barns
around here,” replied Chub, flippantly. “However,
whatever we do let us <em>not</em>—remark the emphasis,
please—let us NOT ask for milk!”</p>

<p>They trudged southward along the winding
road. At intervals they came to advertisements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of “Noble’s Chill and Fever Compound” nailed to
fence-rails and trees. For a while Dick religiously
bowed and saluted each one, but at last his
anger wore itself out and he only growled when
he saw one. They had been walking for perhaps
a quarter of an hour when a turn in the road disclosed
what, at first sight, appeared to be a light
in the window of a house, but their murmurs of
satisfaction were quickly ended, for, as they approached
they saw that the light was the tail lamp
of an automobile standing by the side of the road.</p>

<p>“Wait!” whispered Dick, seizing Roy by the
arm. “Maybe it’s old Ewing and the constable.”</p>

<p>“And where would they get an automobile?”
asked Roy.</p>

<p>“They might; you can’t tell. Better let me go
ahead and have a look first.” But the others
laughed him to scorn. Just then a second light
came into sight, and, as they were now close to
the car, they saw that some one had been leaning
with it over the engine.</p>

<p>“She’s broken down,” said Chub. As they
drew near, the man with the lantern held it up
until its rays shone on them, when, as though he
had hoped for better things, he turned indifferently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
away and began to pull things from under
the rear seat. It was a large car, seating seven,
and was painted gray with trimming of some
darker color.</p>

<p>“Having trouble?” asked Chub, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“No, I’m just spending the night here from
choice,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a pretty spot,” laughed Chub.
“Anything we can do for you?” The man turned
and regarded Chub, disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, get out!”</p>

<p>“Of course!” said Chub. “That’s easy. I
asked you a civil question, though. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” called the other. “I didn’t mean
to be haughty. But I’ve been stuck here since
six o’clock and I don’t know yet what the trouble
is. That’s enough to make a man rather peevish,
isn’t it?” He laughed grudgingly. He was
about twenty-one or -two years old, with a good-looking,
if at present not over clean, face, and a
nice voice.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” answered Chub. “You’ve had
your supper though, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve had that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we haven’t. And we’ve been chasing
around the country for an hour and a half on foot.
And we’re tired and hungry. I imagine we’re
entitled to a little peevishness too, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said the other. “Where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“No one knows,” said Chub. “We’re just
walking along this road in the hope that some
day we’ll come to a place where we can get something
to eat. What do you think the chances
are?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d do better if you went the other
way. You won’t find a hotel or a store nearer
than five miles in this direction.”</p>

<p>Dick groaned.</p>

<p>“I wish this old thing would go,” continued the
automobilist. “Then I’d help you out. I suppose
you don’t know anything about these
things?” His glance ranged over the three faces.</p>

<p>“Well I don’t know that kind,” answered
Chub, “but I’ve had a little experience with a
four-cylinder Adams. May be, though, if we start
and go over her again together we’ll find the
trouble. Getting your spark all right, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, the trouble is somewhere in the engine, I
guess.”</p>

<p>Chub took off his coat and hung it on a fence
post.</p>

<p>For a while Dick and Roy looked on, following
the others around the car in the glow of the lantern.
Then Dick asked permission to get in and
sit down and he and Roy sank onto the cushions
of the rear seats and stretched their tired legs
luxuriously. The minutes came and went. They
listened drowsily to the talk of Chub and the
owner of the machine, to the clink of tools, the
turning of the crank. The full moon worked
itself out of a cloud bank and cast a faint radiance
over the scene. A breeze came rustling
across a corn-field, and Roy reached down sleepily
and pulled a robe over him. By that time Dick was
frankly slumbering. A half-hour passed since
their arrival. Suddenly, there was a grunt of
satisfaction from the automobilist, an amused
laugh from Chub and a jarring that awoke the
boys in the tonneau. The engine was going.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’d ever have found that without
you,” the owner was saying gaily as he slammed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the tool-chest shut. “Pile in now, and I’ll
give you a lift.”</p>

<p>“Is it all right?” asked Roy, drowsily.</p>

<p>“Yes, Siree; your friend here is a regular genius.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s my middle name,” answered
Chub as he climbed into the front seat. “Wake
up, Dick, we’re going to supper!”</p>

<p>“I am awake. Where are we going to get it?”</p>

<p>“By jove!” muttered their new acquaintance.
“I wonder, myself.” He was silent a moment, but
when the car was rushing along smoothly into
the flood of white light thrown by the powerful
lamps, he turned his head. “Look here, you fellows.
My name’s Whiting, Joe Whiting, and I
live about seven miles down the road. All my
folks are away for the summer and I’m going myself
to-morrow, and so things aren’t in very good
shape for guests. But if you chaps don’t mind
bunking around on mattresses and couches I’ll
be glad to put you up for the night. Any way, I
can give you plenty to eat. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“If you weren’t steering,” answered Chub,
“I’d fall on your neck! We accept your kind invitation,
Mr. Whiting. We are too far gone to
have any sense of decency left; we accept anything
and everything you want to offer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154-<br />155]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Whiting, jovially.
“That’s good. Do you fellows mind going a bit
fast?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” answered Roy and Dick in a
breath. The big car shot forward and the wind
rushed by them. The road was fairly straight
and level and quite deserted, and the car tossed
the miles behind in a way that made the boys
stare.</p>

<p>“Going all right now!” bawled Whiting in
Chub’s ear.</p>

<p>“None too fast for me—Whoa!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Cap’s gone. It doesn’t matter, though.”</p>

<p>“Lost your cap? I’ll stop and you can—”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it,” begged Chub. “I couldn’t find
it in a week—besides I’d rather lose a dozen caps
than have this stop!”</p>

<p>On they went into the white radiance. Trees
and fences and poles rushed toward them from
the glare ahead and disappeared into the blackness
behind. The road was following the railroad
now, and for an exciting minute or two they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
raced a train and gained on it, and would have
left it behind, perhaps, had the road not swerved
to the left and taken them out of sight. There
was a defiant shriek from the engine, a brief
glimpse of the lighted car windows through the
trees and they were once more alone, coasting
down a long hill with only the whirr of the fan
to be heard. A few minutes later the car swept
from the public road through a stone-pillared
gateway and circled up to a big house in which
a single light gleamed through the transom above
the front door.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look very gay, does it?” inquired
their host. “I don’t doubt the servant has gone
to bed. We’ll run around and leave the machine,
if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>They got out when the car had trundled itself
into the garage and stretched their cramped
limbs.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” said Dick, “that I changed
my position once all the way. I had a sort of a
notion that if I moved we’d go flying off the road
into the next county. That was a dandy ride, Mr.
Whiting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Glad you liked it. Come on now and let’s eat.
I had dinner at six, but can dally with a little supper.
I’m afraid, though,” he added as he locked
the doors, “I can’t give you fellows anything hot
except coffee.”</p>

<p>“Hot or cold, it’s all the same to us,” said
Roy.</p>

<p>Mr. Whiting unlocked the front door and admitted
them to a wide hall and from there conducted
them into a big library and flooded it
with light at the touch of a button.</p>

<p>“Make yourselves at home now. If you want to
wash come on up-stairs. You needn’t be afraid
of making a noise, the place is empty except for
Williams and he’s at the back of the house and
wouldn’t hear a sound if he wasn’t.”</p>

<p>They trooped up after him to the bath-room
and washed the dust from hands and faces. Chub,
smoothing his hair with the silver-backed brushes
which their host provided, encountered in the
glass the gaze of Whiting fixed on him speculatively.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s your name?” asked Whiting.</p>

<p>“My name’s Eaton,” answered Chub. “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
my companions are Mr. Porter and Mr. Somes. I
beg your pardon, I’m sure; we ought to have
introduced ourselves before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right; I only asked because it
seems to me I’ve seen you before somewhere.”</p>

<p>“It’s possible, I live in Pittsburg.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t have to tell,” said Dick, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been there,” said Whiting, “but
all the same—Well, never mind. Let’s go down
and see what we can find.”</p>

<p>They found a good deal. Together they raided
the pantry and refrigerator and bore their booty
into the dining-room and spread it helter-skelter
on the big mahogany table. Then they made coffee,
about two quarts of it, and if it wasn’t perfectly
clear it at least tasted very, very good.
It was after nine o’clock when they sat down to
supper and it was well toward ten when they got
up. It takes some time to satisfy such hungers as
Chub and Roy and Dick had. But, of course, they
didn’t spend quite all the time eating, for Whiting’s
curiosity had to be satisfied and so it was
incumbent to narrate the adventure in search of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
milk. Whiting thought that a fine joke and
wished he had been along.</p>

<p>“I tell you what I’ll do, fellows,” he said. “In
the morning I’ll take you back in the car, if you
don’t mind starting rather early, and you won’t
have much difficulty finding your boat in broad
daylight. I hope no one has stolen anything out
of it, though.”</p>

<p>Back in the library the boys stretched themselves
out comfortably in the big leather chairs,
and Whiting turned to Chub with;</p>

<p>“Say, Eaton, do you play ball?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some.”</p>

<p>“Only some, eh? I thought that maybe I’d
seen you on the ball field, but—”</p>

<p>“He’s a fibber,” said Dick. “He was captain
of his freshman team this year and played on the
’varsity in the big game.”</p>

<p>“Jupiter!” cried Whiting. “I remember now!
You’re the chap they put in for Pritchett at the
end of the game; you stole home and won the
game! That was all right, Eaton!” Whiting
beamed across at him. “Thunder, I’m glad I
picked you fellows up! I’m a junior next year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
You must come and see me. Are you in college,
too?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Roy. “I’m in the same class
with Chub, and Dick enters in the fall.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine! It was good luck that I came
across you to-night. If I hadn’t I’d been stuck
back there in the road yet!”</p>

<p>After that there was plenty to talk about, you
may believe, and it was well toward midnight
when they climbed the stairs and distributed themselves
around the empty bedrooms.</p>

<p>“I suppose I might find sheets and blankets and
things,” said Whiting, apologetically, “but the
mater has them put away somewhere and I
wouldn’t know where to look for them. But if
a couple of you chaps will only take my bed I’ll
be perfectly comfortable in another room.”</p>

<p>“So will we,” said Chub. “Don’t you bother.
A good hair mattress like this is all a fellow needs,
anyway; and it’s too warm for covers if we had
them. We’ll be all right, thank you. But you’ll
have to wake us up in the morning. I feel as
though I could sleep for a week!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; you’ll be called early
enough. I told Williams to have breakfast at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
seven. I’ve got over a hundred miles to do in
the car to-morrow and want to get started early.
Good-night, fellows. I do hope you’ll be comfortable.”</p>

<p>“If I felt any better,” murmured Chub,
sprawled out on a big wide bed which he was to
have all to himself, “I’d certainly yell. Good-night,
Whiting. May you be forever blest!”</p>

<p>They slept finely, were up at half past six, had
shower-baths, and were seated around the table
at a little after seven. Williams tried hard not
to show the astonishment he felt at finding the
family circle so suddenly and inexplicably enlarged,
but didn’t altogether succeed. At eight
they were in the car again, retracing their path
of the night before, Chub attired in a plaid cap
which his host insisted on his accepting. It was
a wonderful golden morning with the bluest of
blue skies overhead and an innocent-looking pile
of fluffy white clouds in the west, which Whiting
declared meant a thunder-storm later on. But no
one was troubled about that. The big gray car
was on its best behavior, and in less than half an
hour they were back in the vicinity of the <i>Slow
Poke</i>. After some hesitation, they decided on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
spot to be set down and bade their new friend
good-by.</p>

<p>“Mind you look me up in the fall,” he reiterated.
“I want to introduce you to some of the
fellows I know; you’ll like them. Good-by and
good luck. Hope you find your boat.”</p>

<p>He was off again in a cloud of dust and the
three turned and plunged into the woods. Their
judgment was not in error, for after a minute or
so they came out on the shore of the cove.
Twenty yards away lay the <i>Slow Poke</i>.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” said Roy, devoutly. “I
thought—”</p>

<p>But he didn’t tell what he thought. Instead,
he stopped suddenly in his tracks, and Chub and
Dick stopped with him.</p>

<p>Sitting on the rail of the <i>Slow Poke</i>, his gun
across his knees, was Farmer Ewing.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>MR. EWING IS OUTWITTED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Well, what do you think of that?” gasped
Chub.</p>

<p>The boys stared at Mr. Ewing in vexation, and
Mr. Ewing regarded the boys with grim placidity.</p>

<p>“Just as though he hadn’t made trouble enough
for us,” muttered Dick.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Roy, starting on determinedly,
“I’m not going to put up with any more of his
nonsense.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” cautioned Chub, “but remember,
chum, that he has a gun there.”</p>

<p>They walked along the bank until they were opposite
the boat. Mr. Ewing watched them silently,
his gaze resting with interest on Dick.
Evidently he couldn’t account for Dick. Chub
made the first overtures.</p>

<p>“Salutations,” he called.</p>

<p>“Mornin’,” responded the farmer. A silence
followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Want to see us, did you?” asked Chub, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” drawled the farmer, “I wanted to
have a few words with ye.”</p>

<p>“We are deeply honored, sir. Tell the gentleman
how deeply honored we are, Roy.” But Roy
only growled. The farmer sniffed.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We’re coming aboard,” replied Chub, making
ready to leap the yard of water that intervened
between shore and boat.</p>

<p>“You just stay where you are,” said the
farmer, patting his gun stock significantly.</p>

<p>“But that’s our boat!” cried Roy, wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Maybe, maybe; chances are you stole it,
though,” replied Mr. Ewing, calmly.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re the most suspicious man I ever
did see,” declared Chub, disgustedly. “Suppose
we insist on going aboard; what’s going to happen?”</p>

<p>“I might have to put a load of buckshot in
your legs,” answered the farmer, showing his
yellow fangs in a grim smile. “This boat is confiscated.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say? What for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pendin’ the arrival of the constable. You
can talk to him when he gets here; I guess he’ll
answer all the questions you want to ask him.”
The farmer chuckled. Roy appeared to be in
real danger of exploding with anger.</p>

<p>“Leave this to me,” whispered Chub. Then,
“and about how long do you think we’ll have
to wait for the constable?” he inquired of Mr.
Ewing. The farmer cast an eye toward the sun.</p>

<p>“About half an hour, I guess,” he replied.
“He promised to be over about nine.”</p>

<p>“As early as that, eh?” murmured Chub, reflectively.
“I hate to put him to so much trouble.
I do hope you and he didn’t lose much time last
night looking for us. We were so sorry we
couldn’t stay until you returned, but we had an
engagement we just had to keep.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you bother about me,” growled the
farmer. “Think you’re pretty smart, I guess,
don’t ye? Maybe you did fool me last night, but
I sort o’ guess I’ve got ye this time, eh?”</p>

<p>“It does look like it,” admitted Chub, reluctantly.
“But then you’re too smart for us, anyway,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” grunted the farmer, suspiciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“We might as well sit down and take it easy
while we wait,” said Chub to the others. “Me
for a nice spot in the shade.”</p>

<p>He moved down the shore a little way and Roy
and Dick followed. When they sat down under
the shade of the trees they were out of hearing of
the farmer.</p>

<p class="cap">“Anybody got anything to suggest?” Chub asked
softly.</p>

<p>“If we rushed him all at once, the three of
us,” said Dick, “we could get aboard all right.
You know very well he wouldn’t dare shoot at
us.”</p>

<p>But Chub shook his head.</p>

<p>“He’s such an old sour-face, he’s likely to do
anything. What do you say, Roy?”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk it if the rest of you will,” he said,
angrily. “I’d like to throw him into the water.”</p>

<p>“A bath wouldn’t do him any harm,” said
Chub, “unless he caught cold from it. But I’ve
got a better scheme, I think. We can’t afford to
let the constable find us here. If he does it’ll
take a week to convince him that we aren’t robbers.
Now, listen. I’ll go back through the
woods as though I was going to the road. You
fellows stay here and if he asks where I’ve gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
tell him I’ve gone to look for the constable.
When I get out of sight I’ll get some of my
things off and sneak down to the river again on
the other side of the point. Then I’ll swim back
quietly and get aboard on the other side. He
won’t be able to see me and you fellows mustn’t
look at me because he might catch on.”</p>

<p>“But what are you going to do when you get
aboard?” asked Roy dubiously. Chub’s brown
eyes twinkled merrily.</p>

<p>“You leave that to me,” he said. “Come to
think of it, you fellows had better go back to
the boat in about a couple of minutes and when
you see me coming get him talking; see? Make
all the pow-wow you can, so he won’t hear me.
If he should hear me and go around the other
side to see what’s up, you fellows jump on board
in a hurry. Got that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Roy, “but you—you be careful,
Chub.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be a long swim, won’t it?” asked Dick,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I won’t have to swim at all,” said Chub.
“I’ll just float down with the current. I’m
off.” He got up and started aimlessly into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
woods in the direction of the road. They watched
him go. So did the farmer.</p>

<p>“Hey, where’s he going?” he called.</p>

<p>“Says he’s going to look for your friend, the
constable,” answered Dick, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no use in you running away,” said Mr.
Ewing. “We’ll get ye.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t see us running away, do you?”
asked Roy, haughtily. “We haven’t done anything
to run away for.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose we might fix those ropes
so’s we can let go in a hurry?” asked Dick,
softly.</p>

<p>“We can try it,” responded Roy, with a glance
toward the river beyond the point. “Wait a
minute longer. Then we’ll go down there.
Maybe we can loosen the knots a bit.” He
looked anxiously at his watch. It showed the
hour to be ten minutes to nine. “I hope that
constable doesn’t take it into his head to appear
for a few minutes yet.”</p>

<p>“So do I. Shall we go now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, come along.”</p>

<p>They got up and sauntered back to where the
<i>Slow Poke</i> lay, Mr. Ewing eying them suspiciously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
The boat was moored fore and aft to
two trees growing near the bank. When they
reached the first one Roy stopped and started to
undo the knot, while Dick kept on.</p>

<p>“Say, there’re chairs up there on the deck,”
said Dick, pleasantly. “Why don’t you get one?
You must be tired sitting on that railing.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty tolerable easy, thanks,” answered
the farmer. “Here, you there! What you doing
to that rope?”</p>

<p>“Me?” asked Roy, innocently. “Just fixing
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, leave it alone, do you hear?” The old
shot-gun was pointed in Roy’s direction and Roy
thought it wise to obey, especially as he had practically
accomplished his purpose. Meanwhile
Dick had seized the occasion to give attention to
the second rope, but the farmer spied him before
he could loosen the knot.</p>

<p>“Come away from there or I’ll let ye have
this!” he shouted, angrily. Dick came away and
he and Roy sat down on the edge of the bank in
the sun, trying to look perfectly at ease. A swift
glance upstream showed them a dark object in
the water floating slowly down with the current.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
The object was Chub’s head. They didn’t dare
look again until Chub was almost abreast of the
boat. Then,</p>

<p>“That was a pretty easy place to get out of you
put us in,” said Roy. The farmer blinked his
eyes and motioned at Dick with his chin.</p>

<p>“You’d been there yet if it hadn’t been for
him,” he said. “If I hadn’t been alone there I
guess it wouldn’t have happened.”</p>

<p>“You had Fido,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“He means Carlo,” explained Roy, amiably.
“He’s a pretty smart dog, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Guess you thought so,” chuckled the farmer.
(Roy and Dick were straining their ears for evidences
of Chub’s arrival at the other side of the
boat.)</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s a nice dog,” said Roy, reflectively.
“Of course he isn’t much to look at, but, then,
mongrels never are, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t a mongrel,” said the farmer, indignantly.
“He’s a pure-blooded Saint Bernard,
he is.” (Still there was no sound!)</p>

<p>“You don’t say?” asked Dick. “Funny how
folks will talk to you when they want to sell a
dog, isn’t it? It just seems as though they didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
have any moral sense, doesn’t it?” (There was
a sound now, just the faintest sound in the world!
Roy and Dick both plunged desperately into conversation.)</p>

<p>“Dogs are funny things, anyway—” began
Dick.</p>

<p>“I used to know a dog that looked just like
Carlo,” Roy declared with enthusiasm. “He was
the knowingest thing—”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he?” asked Dick, loudly and eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, that dog knew more than any farmer
I ever met!” almost shouted Roy. “Just to show
you how knowing he was, Mr. Ewing—!”</p>

<p>Then Roy stopped with a grin on his face and
he and Dick looked past the farmer until that
worthy’s curiosity got the better of him and he
turned likewise, turned to look into the twin muzzles
of Chub’s shot-gun, which the owner, damp
and cheerful in his scant attire, held a yard from
the farmer’s head.</p>

<p>Mr. Ewing’s jaw dropped comically.</p>

<p>“Wh-wh-what—” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Kindly lean your gun against the railing, Mr.
Ewing,” said Chub, softly. “Thank you. Now
get down and jump ashore, please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I’ll have you fellers put in prison for
this!” growled the farmer. But he was far more
subdued than they’d ever seen him, and he swung
his long legs over the railing and strode to the
gangway at the rear. “What you going to do
with my gun?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Never you mind about your gun,” said Chub.
“You git!”</p>

<p>Mr. Ewing “got.”</p>

<p>“Throw off those ropes, fellows,” said Chub,
“and bring them aboard.” He picked up the
farmer’s gun, unloaded it, and tossed it onto the
bank. “Nothing but birdshot, after all,” he
scoffed as he glanced at the shells.</p>

<p>Mr. Ewing only grunted as he picked up his
gun. Then,</p>

<p>“You’re a pretty cute lot, you are, but you
wait until the next time, by gum!”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any next time, by gum,”
laughed Chub.</p>

<p>Dick and Roy, keeping watchful glances on the
farmer, brought the ropes aboard.</p>

<p>“Start her up,” said Chub to Dick. Then he
handed his shot-gun to Roy. “See that he
doesn’t try any tricks,” he said. “I’ll go up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and take the wheel. I want to get out of here
before the constable comes.”</p>

<p>The farmer stood a little way off observing
them sourly. The propeller began to churn and
the <i>Slow Poke</i> waddled off into deep water.
Chub threw the wheel hard over and the boat
swung its nose around until it pointed down-stream.
Then he called for full speed and the
<i>Slow Poke</i> made off in a hurry.</p>

<p>“My love to Carlo!” cried Chub from the wheel-house.</p>

<p>“Tell him I hope he chokes!” added Roy vindictively.</p>

<p>At that moment a man in a faded blue coat with
brass buttons came out of the woods and hurried
toward the farmer. Hasty explanations followed
on the part of the latter.</p>

<p>Chub put his lips to the speaking-tube.</p>

<p>“Got her full speed, Dick?” he called.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“All right. Our friend, the constable, has arrived.
Keep her going.” The <i>Slow Poke</i> was
now far out of the cove and making good time
down the river. Roy waved a polite farewell to
the two figures on shore; the whistle croaked, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the next minute the wooded point had shut them
from view. Roy hurried up to Chub.</p>

<p>“What are you going down the river for?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Because they may send out warrants for us,”
answered Chub. “I want them to think we’re
going this way. After a while we’ll turn around,
go over toward the other shore and come back.
I’ve got to get rid of these wet clothes.”</p>

<p>When he came back, once more in conventional
attire, he headed the boat across to the opposite
shore, turned her and crept upstream again. Roy
brought his field-glasses up and they searched the
shore of the cove as they went by. But there was
no one in sight.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he’s had enough?” pondered Roy.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he hasn’t. I’ll bet if we came back
here fifty years from now we’d find him sitting
on the fence outside his gate with that old popgun
in his lap, waiting for us. You don’t know
the—the indomitable will of our dear friend, Job
Ewing.”</p>

<p>“Jim,” corrected Roy.</p>

<p>“Pardon me; I meant to say James. No, Jim
won’t forget us in a hurry, and I think it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
wiser to keep on this side of the river for a while.
That’s Westchester County over there and this
is Rockland. I don’t know much about such
things, I’m pleased to say, but it seems to me
that if that old farmer gets out a warrant for us
we’ll be better off in some other county.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about your coat
and things, though?” Roy asked.</p>

<p>“Get ’em this evening,” answered Chub, “when
the shades of night have fallen over hill and vale.
Let’s put in around that point there and stay
until then, shall we? I don’t believe they can
see us from the other shore.”</p>

<p>Dick joined them and they talked it over and
finally agreed to Chub’s plan. The <i>Slow Poke</i>
was steered around the point and anchored—since
a shallow beach made it inadvisable to
stretch lines ashore—near a little village. The
railroad ran along within a few yards and a tiny
station was in sight. But the point of land cut
them off from sight of Farmer Ewing’s neighborhood
and they believed that they could spend
the day there safely. They went ashore and made
a few purchases and learned that the nearest
ferry was four miles up the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“That would mean a good five miles upstream
and four miles back if they tried to get us that
way,” said Chub. “And I don’t believe they’d
go to that trouble. Besides, it’s safe that they
think we’re still going down the river.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said Dick, “one of us had
better keep a lookout all the time so that if they
did try to get us we could skip out.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Dickums. Yours is the wisdom
of the owl and the cunning of the serpent.”</p>

<p>They spent a quiet day. They would have liked
to go ashore and tramp, but didn’t dare leave
the boat lest the relentless Mr. Ewing should descend
upon it in their absence. So, instead, they
read and wrote letters on the upper deck under
the awning, which was stretched for the first time.
To be sure, they had been away from home only
two days, but, as Roy pointed out, more had happened
to write about during those two days than
was likely to happen in the next two weeks, and
they might as well make the most of it. The quiet
lasted until about four o’clock when Whiting’s
thunder-storm, which had been growling menacingly
for an hour or more, descended upon them
in full fury. There was a busy time getting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
awning down again, and then, somewhat damp,
they retreated to the forward cabin and watched
the rain lash the river and listened to the roaring
of the storm. It was all over in half an hour,
leaving the air cool and refreshing. They had
a good supper and afterward, at about eight,
pulled up anchor and headed the <i>Slow Poke</i> diagonally
down the river until it was opposite the
place where Chub had undressed and left his coat.
There Chub jumped into the tender and rowed
ashore. The others watched anxiously while the
<i>Slow Poke</i> sauntered along with the current but
in five minutes Chub was back again, his clothes
in a bundle in the bottom of the tender.</p>

<p>“Didn’t see a soul,” he answered in response
to the questions of the others. “Start her up,
Dick, and we’ll go back.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t so easy to sleep that night, for
the trains went rushing by on an average of every
half hour, shrieking and clattering. But they
managed to doze off at intervals until well toward
morning when, having become inured to the racket,
they slept soundly until the alarm-clock in Chub’s
bedroom went off.</p>

<p>“I move you,” said Chub at breakfast, “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
we get out of this vicinity as soon as we can.
I’ve had enough excitement to last me for a
month. I’m for the silent reaches and the simple
life!”</p>

<small>CHUB TRIES A NEW BAIT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">I could write in detail of the next three days,
but the narrative would only bore you, for
nothing of special interest happened. In brief,
then, they made an early start the morning after
the escape from Mr. Ewing and the arm of the law,
and were soon rounding the bend in the river
opposite Peekskill. By one o’clock they were in
sight of West Point and so kept on until they
found a mooring at the steamboat pier. There
they ate dinner and afterward spent two hours
“doing” the Military Academy. Dick declared
that if they didn’t see another thing, that alone
was worth the whole trip, and the rest agreed
with him. At twilight, they sidled the <i>Slow Poke</i>
across to shore almost under the frowning face
of Storm King. There was deep water there,
and when the mooring ropes were made fast they
could step from the deck of the house-boat right
onto the bank. The map showed dozens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
streams and several small ponds, and it was decided
that they would remain there for a while and
try the fishing. They slept on board that night,
but the next afternoon they rigged the little shelter
tent which they had brought between the
trees at a little distance from shore, and made
camp. Dick and Roy fashioned a fireplace of
stones and when the weather was fair the meals
were prepared over a wood fire. Chub declared
that he preferred the flavor of wood smoke to
kerosine. For two days they tramped around
the neighboring country and fished to their hearts’
content, finding several good trout pools. It was
on the second day that Chub caught his “two-pounder.”
To be sure, Dick and Roy declared
that it didn’t weigh over a pound and a quarter,
but Chub retorted that that was only their jealousy
and that if there was a scales on board
he would soon prove his estimate correct. But
there wasn’t a scales to be found and so Chub’s
claim was never disproved. He held the trout
out at arm’s-length while Roy photographed it,
and when the picture developed the fish looked
like a salmon rather than a trout.</p>

<p>“You might as well call it a ten-pounder as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a two,” said Dick. “Anyone would believe you.
Why, that fish is half as big as you—in the picture!”</p>

<p>Chub viewed him sorrowfully and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“That,” he replied, “would not be the truth,
Dickums. When you know me better you’ll find
that not even a fish can tempt me from the path
of honesty. Perhaps, however, there wouldn’t
be any harm in calling it a three-pounder; what
do you think?”</p>

<p>Roy and Dick had good luck, too, although their
trout were smaller than Chub’s “two-pounder,”
and during their stay at Camp Storm King, as
they called it, they had all the fresh fish they
could eat.</p>

<p>The day after Chub’s famous catch he informed
the others that he was going back to the scene of
his victory for another try.</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” said Roy, pleasantly, with a
wink at Dick. “It must be a dandy place.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” replied Chub,
shortly. “That pool is my discovery.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” said Roy, “if I found a good place
like that I’d want you to try it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Me, too,” said Dick. Chub viewed them
scornfully.</p>

<p>“Of course you would,” he replied with deep
sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Well, I would,” insisted Roy. “I’d be generous.
Now—”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re like the Irishman,” said Chub.
“His name was Pat.”</p>

<p>“It always is in a story,” murmured Dick.</p>

<p>“One day his friend Mike met him and said:
‘Pat, they tell me you’re a Socialist.’ ‘I am,’
says Pat. ‘Well, now, tell me, Pat, what is a Socialist?’
‘A Socialist,’ says Pat, ‘is a feller that
divides his property equally. ’Tis like this, do
you see: if I had two million dollars I’d give you
one million and I’d keep one million myself.’
‘’Tis a grand idea,’ says Mike. ‘And if you had
two farms would you give me one, Pat?’ ‘Sure
would I,’ says Pat. ‘’Tis an elegant thing, this
Socialism,’ says Mike. ‘But, tell me, Pat, if you
had two pigs would you give me one?’ ‘Go
’long, now!’ says Pat. ‘You know I’ve <em>got</em> two
pigs!’”</p>

<p>“It’s a funny story,” said Roy, mournfully,
“but I miss the application, Chub.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“You do, eh? Well, it just shows how easy it
is to be generous with something you haven’t
got.” Whereupon Chub picked up his rod and
stepped ashore.</p>

<p>“You won’t get a bite!” called Dick.</p>

<p>Haughty silence from Chub as he walked away.</p>

<p>“You won’t bring home a thing!” This shot
told.</p>

<p>“If I don’t bring home something as big as I
did yesterday,” announced Chub, grandly “I’ll—I’ll
wash up the dishes!”</p>

<p>“That’s a go,” cried Dick. “Bad luck to
you!”</p>

<p>They watched him disappear between the trees.
Then Roy turned to Dick with a grin. “Let’s
follow him,” he said.</p>

<p>An instant later, carrying their rods, they were
on Chub’s trail. They went quickly and quietly,
and soon had their quarry in sight. Chub was
ambling along very leisurely, whistling as he
went. Presently they were out of the woods and
on a narrow road that was scarcely more than a
path. It wound along the bottom of the mountain
for a half a mile or so, running very straight and
rendering it necessary for the pursuers to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
in among the trees lest Chub should glance back.
But it was apparent that he had no suspicion.
The road ran over or through several small
streams which came gurgling down the hill and
at each of them Roy and Dick expected to see
Chub leave the road. But he kept on and presently
Dick gave signs of discouragement.</p>

<p>“Thunder,” he said, “I don’t believe he’s ever
going to stop. This isn’t much fun, Roy. Let’s
quit. I’m all scratched up with these branches.”</p>

<p>“Stop nothing!” answered Roy. “He can’t
be going much further. Anyway, the road curves
pretty soon and then we can take it easy.”</p>

<p>Presently the road did curve, Chub was out of
sight, and they left the underbrush with sighs of
relief.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea where this pool of his is?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Not the slightest. He and I started out together
but he left me about three o’clock and went down
toward the river. We were fishing that stream
that comes down near the fork of the roads, you
know; where we were the first day. That’s about
half a mile further, but I don’t see why Chub has
to go that far unless he can’t find his old pool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
any other way. Here’s the turn. Careful, or he
may see us.”</p>

<p>It was an abrupt curve and they went very
slowly and softly until they could see the stretch
of road ahead. It was quite deserted!</p>

<p>“Shucks!” said Roy. “He’s got away from
us, after all. Come on!”</p>

<p>They broke into a trot and hurried along, looking
sharply to left and to right as they ran. A
moment or two later there was a rustling in the
woods near the turn of the road and Chub came
cautiously out, a broad smile on his face. Remaining
in concealment, he watched his pursuers
until another turn of the road hid them. Then
he cut a branch from a small tree, sharpened one
end of it, slit the other, and stuck it in the middle
of the road. Searching his pockets he, at
length, brought forth a crumpled piece of paper.
Smoothing it out, he traced a single word on it
and stuck it in the cleft of the stick. Then, chuckling
aloud, he crossed the road and disappeared
into the woods on the lower side.</p>

<p>Some two hours later Roy and Dick came trudging
back. They had five trout between them, but
they were all small ones. They were very hungry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and somewhat tired, and Roy almost walked
into the stick in the road before he saw the piece
of paper. When he had read it he laughed and
handed it to Dick.</p>

<p>“‘Stung!’” read Dick. He grinned, crumpled
it up, and tossed it aside, and they went on for a
moment without a word. Then,</p>

<p>“You have to get up pretty early to get ahead
of Chub,” said Roy, admiringly.</p>

<p>“Get up early!” quoth Dick. “You have to
stay up all night!”</p>

<p>They trudged on home to the camp and dinner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Chub was having hard luck. Fully
a mile away, where a stream rushed down a hill
and paused for a while in a broad black pool
lined with rocks and alders, he had been fishing
diligently for over an hour with no success. He
had tried almost every one of his brand-new assortment
of flies, but, to use his own expression,
he hadn’t even got a bid. It was getting along
toward dinner-time, as his hunger emphatically
informed him, and he recollected his agreement
with regret. It wasn’t that he so much disliked
to wash the dishes for once—although as a matter
of principle he always schemed to avoid that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
task—but he hated to have Roy and Dick crow
over him. And after the way in which he had
fooled them that morning, he had no doubt but
that they would crow long and loud!</p>

<p>He sat down on a convenient flat-topped stone
and spread his fly-book open beside him. It was
a sunny day, but the pool was well shadowed
and perhaps, after all, a real brilliant fly
wouldn’t be out of the way. So he selected a
handsome arrangement of vermilion and yellow
and gray—a most gaudy little fly it was—and substituted
it for the more somber one on his line.
Then he cast again to the farther side of the
pool. For a while there was no reply to his appeal,
and then the fly disappeared and a moment
later a gleaming trout was flapping about under
the bushes. It wasn’t such a bad little trout;
Chub guessed three quarters of a pound as its
weight; and more hopefully now, he flicked the
pool here and there. But nothing else happened.
At last, discouraged, he reeled in his line and
looked at his watch. The time was a quarter
past twelve. Even if he started back to the boat
now, he would arrive very late for dinner. Besides,
he couldn’t face Roy and Dick with only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that insignificant trophy to show. If only he had
brought a luncheon with him! His eyes fell again
on the trout and his face lighted. Dropping
his fly-book into his pocket and picking up rod
and fish, he turned his back on the pool and followed
the stream as best he could, winding in
and out of the thickets and clambering over the
rocks that strewed the little vale.</p>

<p>Presently he was out of the thicket and before
him lay a small clearing in which waist-high
bushes and trailing briars ran riot. The brook
spread itself out into a shallow stream and meandered
off toward the river, its course marked by
small willows, alders, and rushes. Chub found a
clear spot in the shade of a viburnum and built
a fire of dry grass and twigs, adding dead branches
as the flames grew. Fuel wasn’t very easy to find,
but by prospecting around he eventually had a
good-sized blaze. Then, warm and panting, he
sat down out of the range of the heat and prepared
his trout. By the time it was ready the
fire had subsided to a bed of glowing coals.
Wrapping the fish in leaves he laid it on the
embers and watched it carefully, turning it over
and over and raking the hot coals about it. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
fifteen minutes of cooking he took it off and laid
it on a stone which he had meanwhile washed in
the brook. Then, with a couple of sharpened
sticks he scraped away the ashes and coals, and
began his luncheon. Trout without any other
seasoning than wood smoke isn’t awfully appetizing,
as Chub speedily discovered, and he would
have given a whole lot for a pinch or two of salt.
But it partly satisfied his hunger, and after he
had taken a drink of cold water from the brook
he felt good for another two or three hours’ fishing.
He was determined not to go home until he
had something to show. He stretched himself
out in the shade for a while and rested. Then,
picking up his rod once more, he returned to the
stream and sought a likely spot.</p>

<p>His search led him across the clearing and into
a dense woods beyond. Here the stream narrowed
again and deepened, and he put another
fly on and tried his luck, wandering along from
place to place. Twice, inquiring fish nibbled at
his fly, and once he hooked a small trout only to
lose it from the hook in landing. Then a full
hour passed without any results. It was almost
three o’clock. The woods were very warm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
very still, only the ripple and plash of the brook
breaking the mid-afternoon silence. Even the
birds were hushed. But the mosquitoes, at least,
were active, and Chub, hot and discouraged,
brushed them away and sighed for a breeze.
Finally he sat down on the ground and for the
twentieth time viewed the contents of his fly-book
in perplexity. It seemed as though it contained
every sort of fly that the heart of trout could desire.</p>

<p>“Finicky things,” muttered Chub. “I’d just
like to know what they do want.” He picked out
a pretty brown and gray fly tentatively. “That
ought to please any one. Maybe, though, they
don’t like the taste of them. I suppose, when you
come to think of it, steel and feathers and silk
thread aren’t very appetizing—except to look
at. If I was a trout I’d much rather have a
good worm or a nice, juicy grasshopper.”</p>

<p>He paused and stared thoughtfully at the flies.
Then,</p>

<p>“Plagued if I don’t try it!” he murmured.</p>

<p>He got up and retraced his steps to the clearing.
Ordinarily it’s the easiest thing in the
world to catch a grasshopper. All you have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
do is to stand still and the silly things will jump
onto you; especially if you happen to have on
something white. But to-day Chub found the
grasshopper the most illusive of game, almost as
illusive as trout! With cap in hand, he crouched
and jumped and ran and waited, missing his prey
time after time, and getting hotter and hotter
and madder and madder, until the perspiration
streamed down his face and he was mentally calling
the grasshoppers all the mean names he could
think of. But perseverance is bound to win in
the long run—and Chub had plenty of long runs!
And so, finally, he was trudging back, tired but
triumphant, with two hoppers firmly clasped in
his hand. But it seemed as though he was having
more than his share of trouble to-day, for although
he had left rod and fly-book not more than
fifty or sixty yards from the edge of the clearing,
he couldn’t find them for a long while, and when
he did he was so tuckered out that he had to lie
on his back for ten minutes before he could command
sufficient energy to go on with his experiment.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194-<br />195]</a></span></p>

<p>He sacrificed the most bedraggled of his flies,
plucking off feathers and silk, and then placed one
of the grasshoppers on the hook. Looking for a
likely spot, he found it a few yards further down
the stream where the uprooted trunk of a big
tree lay across the brook and made a sort of dam.
The bushes grew close to the bank and it was necessary
to make a short cast. The first attempt
wasn’t a success, and he had to wade into the
pool and disentangle his leader from a stump.
Then he crawled out and tried again, assuring
himself that he had already scared every denizen
of the pool into conniption fits and that, of course,
he wouldn’t get a bite. But the grasshopper had
no sooner lit on the surface than there was a
sudden flash and the line spun out.</p>

<p>“Huh!” gasped Chub, his thumb on the reel.
“That pleased you, didn’t it? Come on, now.”</p>

<p><a href="#i_p193">But Mister Trout didn’t want to come</a> on. Instead,
he had hidden himself amongst the submerged
roots of the trees. Chub wound in a foot
or two of line very gingerly, trying to coax the
trout into deep water, and the ruse succeeded.
With a rush the fish darted from concealment
and sped upstream. But Chub brought him up
with a turn that made the line sing. Then he
began to reel in. The trout fought valiantly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
made a good deal of trouble considering his size,
and there were one or two anxious moments for
Chub. But in the end the victory was his, and
back among the stones lay the speckled beauty.
It was a good ten inches long and Chub beamed
with delight. Now he could go home!</p>

<p>When he had secured his prize on a forked
branch he released the other grasshopper from
the pocket of his fly-book.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a narrow escape,” he said, as
the hopper flounced bewildered away, “and considering
the chase you led me I ought to feed you
to the fishes, too. But I won’t. Go on home,
and don’t bat your silly brains out against the
rocks like that.”</p>

<p>At five o’clock Roy and Dick, who were beginning
to get anxious about Chub, beheld that
young gentleman approaching camp. He had his
rod in hand, but no fish were in sight.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” said Dick. “I’ll wager he’s
mad!”</p>

<p>“Had any dinner?” shouted Roy.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you get it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Caught it and cooked it, of course. Say, he
was a dandy! He was as long—”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that,” laughed Roy. “You
wash the dishes just the same. You were to bring
the fish home, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, but I had to have something to eat,
didn’t I?” asked Chub, with a grin.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t in the bargain,” answered Dick.
“You’re dish-washer to-night.” Chub stepped
aboard, reached under his coat, and laid his trout
on the railing.</p>

<p>“Is that so, Dickums?” he asked quickly. The
others stared a moment. Then,</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” murmured Dick.</p>

<p>“You win,” sighed Roy.</p>

<p class="cap">“What day of the month is this?” demanded
Roy.</p>

<p>“Fourteenth,” hazarded Chub.</p>

<p>“Fifteenth,” answered Dick, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“We need a calendar,” said Roy, looking
vaguely about the cabin. “But whether it’s the
fourteenth or fifteenth, fellows, we ought to write
to Harry. She’s going home the twentieth and
we promised to be there in three weeks. That
would be the twenty-first.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Chub. “We’ve only got
seven more days. You write, Roy, like a good
chap.”</p>

<p>“What shall I say?”</p>

<p>“Just tell her we’ll be along the twenty-first.
Of course, we don’t have to start right off after
we get there. I think it would be fun to stay
there a while, don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.” Roy left the window-seat on which he
had been stretched and went over to the table
to write. “Let me take your fountain-pen, Dick,
will you? Mine’s dry.”</p>

<p>“You can take it if you can find it,” answered
Dick, looking up from his book. “I haven’t seen
it since I loaned it to Chub yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Dickums, I gave it back to you,” responded
Chub, gravely. “I remember the circumstances
perfectly; the whole thing comes back to me as
though it were but yesterday.”</p>

<p>“It <em>was</em> but yesterday,” said Dick. “Look in
your pocket.”</p>

<p>“Merely as a matter of form,” murmured
Chub. “Why, here it is! How strange! Some
one must have put it there. Catch, Roy.”</p>

<p>Roy caught, opened the pen, and then gazed
disgustedly from his fingers to Dick.</p>

<p>“I should think you’d have a decent pen, Dick.
This is the limit!”</p>

<p>“Never look a gift pen in the nib,” laughed
Chub. “It is a pretty bad one, though, and
that’s a fact. Let’s serve notice on Dick that
unless he buys a good one we won’t borrow it any
more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the second day after Chub’s success with
the grasshopper bait, and the second day of rain.
Yesterday, it had merely showered at intervals,
and the three had half a day of good fishing, but
since about dawn it had been pouring torrents
and they had been forced to remain indoors save
when, at about eleven, they had gone in bathing.
That had been good fun; there is a certain excitement
about bathing in a heavy downpour of
rain that is missing under other conditions. Chub
had pretended to be disgruntled. “What’s the
use of bathing,” he had asked, “when you’re sopping
wet before you get into the water?” But
he had enjoyed it as much as any of them.</p>

<p>The <i>Slow Poke</i> stood the deluge well, all things
considered. The rain managed to get under the
door of the after cabin until they spread towels
along the sill, and there was a small leak in the
bedroom. But Chub declared that he didn’t
mind as long as it wasn’t over the bed.</p>

<p>“I think,” remarked Dick a few minutes later,
laying down his book with a yawn and glancing
disapprovingly out of the rain-streaked windows,
“that we’ve had enough of this place. Let’s go
on. What do you say, Roy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ask the captain,” said Roy, sealing his note
to Harry.</p>

<p>“Sounds like mutiny to me,” said Chub.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, Dick, let’s mutiny and
stop his talking about it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, why don’t you?” asked Chub, eagerly.
“I’ve been looking forward all along for a mutiny.
I wish to put some one in irons and confine
him in the lazaret.”</p>

<p>“Lazaret nothing!” protested Dick. “The
lazaret is where they put sick folks.”</p>

<p>“Dickums,” responded Chub, superiorly,
“without wishing to hurt your feelings I’d like
to say that you show a lamentable ignorance regarding
things—er—nautical. Let me prescribe
for you a short course of Clark Russell, W. H. G.
Kingston, and Marryat.”</p>

<p>“I’ve read as many of Marryat’s as you have,”
replied Dick, in injured tones. “And I know that
a lazaret is a hospital.”</p>

<p>“On some ships maybe, Dickums,” answered
Chub, amiably, “but not on the <i>Slow Poke</i>. And
speaking of that, fellows, we haven’t changed her
name yet. I thought we were going to get some
paint and fix it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you’re captain,” answered Roy.</p>

<p>“If I am not in error,” responded Chub, with
dignity, “it is the able seaman that does the painting,
and not the captain.”</p>

<p>“The original question,” said Dick, “was, do
we go on or do we stay here?”</p>

<p>“We go on,” answered Chub. “If it stops
raining before five o’clock we’ll go on to-day.
I, too, would visit new scenes. Besides, we must
get somewhere where we can post that note to
Harry. Also, I shall buy a newspaper and find
out what the date is. Why, for all we know, to-day
may be yesterday or to-morrow. Think of
eating yesterday’s supper to-day!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to kick,” said Dick, “but I think
it would be jolly nice to stop somewhere and get
a good meal. It’s all right for you fellows, because
you don’t have to cook everything we have,
but I’m getting tired of eating my own cooking.”</p>

<p>Chub bounded out of his chair and pointed
dramatically at Dick. “Mutiny!” he cried. “Mutiny
at last! Put him in irons, Roy; put him in
irons! Happy I am that I’ve lived to see this
day!”</p>

<p>“Who’ll cook supper?” asked Roy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll let him go before it’s time to cook
supper. Get the irons, Roy.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>Chub struck his forehead in despair, and sank
back into his seat. “Lost! lost! all is lost! We
forgot to bring any irons!”</p>

<p>“We might keel-haul him or hang him from
the yardstick,” suggested Roy, hopefully.</p>

<p>“You mean yardarm, of course,” said Dick.
“But there isn’t any, and I don’t believe we’ve
got a keel that deserves the name. So you’ll have
to think of something else. Meanwhile, I’m going
to get this chap out of trouble.” And he took
up his book again.</p>

<p>“If he only showed the least bit of remorse,”
sighed Chub, observing him sadly, “I might be
merciful. But this—this shameless effrontery
pains me. I tell you what, Roy, we’ll sentence
him to make an omelet for supper.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t any eggs,” said Dick, without
looking up from his book. Chub cast his eyes
to heaven and groaned tragically.</p>

<p>“No eggs! no irons! Ye gods! haven’t we any
of the necessities of life on this ship? What have
we got, Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beans, bacon, potatoes, bread, condensed milk,
coffee, tea, butter, canned peas and tomatoes,
stewed apricots—”</p>

<p>Chub groaned.</p>

<p>“No more, I beg of you! I’m going to look
at the map, fellows, and if there’s a place we can
reach by seven o’clock where we can buy a good
meal, we’ll go there, rain or no rain! What my
soul demands is a course dinner, with clams, soup,
fish, roast, game, salad—” The rest was lost,
for he had disappeared up the iron stairway to
the wheel-house. Dick laid down his book again.</p>

<p>“I think I could stand a few of those things
myself,” he said wistfully.</p>

<p>“So could I,” said Roy. “You’ve done mighty
well, old chap, with what you’ve had to cook, but
there’s nothing like an occasional change. It
would be jolly if we could find a hotel, wouldn’t
it? One of those swell summer resort places
where they have ten courses and four kinds of
dessert. What about it, Chub?”</p>

<p>“All aboard for The Overlook,” answered
Chub gayly as he came down the steps. “It’s
only seven miles up on the other shore. Shall
we start now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it, a hotel?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes, a big one, too. I’ve heard of it often.
It’s where the swells go in summer.”</p>

<p>“That’s the place for me, then,” replied Roy.
“I don’t think it’s raining as hard as it was. Let’s
go out and have a look.”</p>

<p>Not only had the rain somewhat abated, but
there were signs of clearing. Twenty minutes
later the <i>Slow Poke</i> was on her way again.</p>

<p>That evening the captain and crew of the
<i>Slow Poke</i> “re-entered society,” as Chub put it.
They made a landing before six, finding a convenient
place a few hundred yards from a big
hotel which stood on a bluff almost overhanging
the river, and at seven were seated at a table in
the great dining-room, fairly reveling in the feast.
<a href="#i_p207">They had dressed in their best clothes</a>, and made
a very presentable appearance.</p>

<p>“This,” observed Chub, as he spread a yard-square
napkin over his knees and looked at the
menu, “is about what the doctor ordered. Shall
we dally with a little of the caviar, Roy, or
descend at once upon the cherrystone clams. Let
us bear in mind that we have all the evening to
do justice to this meal, and not be hasty. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
French, Dickums, draw a fine distinction between
a <em>gourmand</em> and a <em>gourmet</em>. The former is
merely a glutton, while the latter is a connoisseur,
an epicure. For me, a few of the clams, a little of
the consommé—with radishes and cucumbers,
some of the bluefish, a wee portion of the boiled
fowl, a slice of beef, some potatoes, cauliflower,
beets, and—yes, macaroni <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au gratin</i>, a taste of
the raspberry sherbet, a bit of the salad—”</p>

<p>“Oh, let up, for goodness’ sake!” begged Roy.
“You make me feel as though I had already had
a big dinner. Let’s cut the clams out and get
down to business; I’m hungry. I want soup and
lots of it. Pass the bread, Dick.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a <em>gourmand</em>,” said Chub sorrowfully.
“I beg of you not to spoil your appetite
with bread. Just cast your eye over the
list of things to come, Roy, and hesitate.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” answered Roy, his mouth
full of bread and butter, “I won’t let much get
by me!”</p>

<p>An hour later, they were sipping their after-dinner
coffee and dallying with cheese and crackers.
Then Chub settled a little lower in his chair
with a sigh of blissful satisfaction, and gazed
benevolently about him.</p>

<p>“I feel better,” he murmured, “much better.”</p>

<p>Dick took a long and careful breath.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” he said cautiously, “that I
feel actually better, but I’m sure I feel <em>different</em>.
And I’d rather die of indigestion than starvation
any day!” Roy looked speculatively at the dining-room
door.</p>

<p>“If you think we can walk that far,” he suggested,
“let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p>On the broad piazza they ran into a group of
college friends of Roy and Chub’s, and the rest of
the evening was hilarious enough. By ten o’clock,
at which time they went back to the <i>Slow Poke</i>,
they had enlarged their circle of acquaintances
until it included most of the young folks at the
hotel. The next morning they had breakfast
aboard, but didn’t linger long over it, for all
sorts of delightful things had been arranged. In
the first place, there was tennis on the smooth
clay courts, Roy and Chub engaging in doubles
with a pair of ambitious friends who rather
prided themselves on their prowess with racket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and ball. After four sets, Roy and Chub had
induced a certain amount of modesty in their
opponents, having won three out of the four.
Dick, meanwhile, went down in defeat before a
curly-haired sub-freshman. They had luncheon
at the hotel and went sailing afterward in some
one’s sloop. (It was at no time apparent whose
boat it was, for out of the sixteen fellows who
had crowded aboard, only one hesitated to give
orders, and that one only because he became seasick
as soon as the yacht left her moorings.)
There was more tennis after the cruise was completed,
in which Dick found a foe he could triumph
over. Then they went back to the neglected
<i>Slow Poke</i> and “brushed up” for dinner.</p>

<p>“This social life is truly exciting,” observed
Chub, strolling into the forward cabin with a
whisk broom in his hand. “Has anyone a nice
red tie to lend me?”</p>

<p>No one had, it seemed. Dick ventured the opinion
that a red tie was not a proper adjunct to a
dinner costume, and that precipitated a discussion
that lasted until they were ready to climb the hill
to the hotel, Chub asserting that with a blue serge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
suit nothing was more chaste and recherché than
a nice bright red scarf.</p>

<p>“And, anyway, you wild Westerner,” he
shouted from across the passage, “it’s not for the
likes of you to be setting up as an authority on
masculine attire. If you had your way you’d go
to dinner in chaps and a sombrero!” When they
had reached the table, Chub glanced over the
menu with a disappointed expression, and shook
his head. “That’s the trouble with these hotels,”
he said. “There’s no variety. This bill’s just
about the same as last night’s. The only difference
is that they’ve called the soups by different
names and substituted flounder—which they call
sole—for bluefish.”</p>

<p>“The ice-cream’s different,” said Dick cheerfully.
But Chub refused to be placated.</p>

<p>“It has another name,” he said darkly, “but
you wait until you try it. It will taste the same
as last night’s!”</p>

<p>But he recovered his equanimity as the meal
progressed. He heroically denied himself a second
helping of cream pie, recalling the fact that
there was to be a hop that evening. “It’s hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
enough for me to hop anyway,” he said, “and if
I ate any more pie, I wouldn’t be able to move
out of my chair.” But thanks to his self-denial
Chub was able to do his full duty on the ball-room
floor, and was ably assisted by Roy. Dick, however,
preferred to sit on the piazza and swap
yarns with the curly-haired sub-freshman, and it
was not until he had been forcibly assisted through
a window onto the dancing floor, that he consented
to uphold the honor of the <i>Slow Poke</i>, as Chub
eloquently put it.</p>

<p>The next day, the second of their stay, they
gave a luncheon on board the house-boat. Dick
cooked the viands and they were served under
the awning on the upper deck. The menu was
neither varied nor extensive, but each of the invited
guests vowed that they had never tasted
anything better. And, of course, it was lots of
fun. Even when Dick spilled the chops all up
and down the steps and had to wipe them off before
he could serve them no one grumbled. In
fact you’d have thought that the party preferred
their chops that way! After luncheon the <i>Slow
Poke</i> was persuaded to sidle out into the stream,
and for an hour she waddled up or down the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Every one of the guests insisted on signing articles
with Captain Chub at once, and it required
all of the latter’s tact and diplomacy to ward them
off.</p>

<p>“I wish you fellows could come along,” he said,
“but you see how it is. We’ve got to go on up
to Ferry Hill and get Doctor Emery and his
daughter, so there won’t be much room.”</p>

<p>Whereupon one of the more enthusiastic fellows
declared that he’d ask nothing better than to
sleep on deck, and the other seven echoed him.
It required a deal of argument to persuade them
of the impracticability of the plan. There was
another jolly evening at the big hotel, and then the
three bade good-by to their old friends and new,
for the <i>Slow Poke</i> was to go on her way again in
the morning. But when morning came, they
found that they were not to leave unattended, for
half a dozen of the fellows had gathered on the
landing to see them off and wish them good luck.</p>

<p>“See you in September,” they shouted as the
<i>Slow Poke</i> ambled away. “Don’t get arrested
for exceeding the speed limit.”</p>

<p>“Stop when you come back, fellows! Don’t
forget!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going to practise serving, Somes! I’ll
beat you this Fall!” (This from the curly-haired
sub-freshman.)</p>

<p>Chub tooted the whistle frenziedly, there was
much waving of caps, and the landing fell away
astern.</p>

<p>The <i>Slow Poke</i> made good time that day.
They stopped above Poughkeepsie for dinner and
in the afternoon went on up against a stiff tide
as far as Kingston. It was a day of alternate
sun and cloud and the scenery on both sides of
the broad stream merited all the attention they
gave it. For the most part, when not busy with
navigation, they sat under the awning and were
beautifully lazy. Just before sunset, they tied up
to the bank and prepared supper. Their three
days of hotel living had quite restored their appetite
for the plainer fare which Dick provided,
and they went at their meals with keen appreciation.
They went early to bed, for it was the
evening of the eighteenth and they were due at
Ferry Hill on the twenty-first, and there remained
a full forty miles to be covered. There was an
early start the next morning, and that day and
the next the <i>Slow Poke</i> attended strictly to business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and climbed the river slowly but surely.
The only incident of moment occurred on the
twentieth when, having stopped for dinner at a
little village and moored to the side of a ferry
slip, the sign on a neighboring building caught
Roy’s eye.</p>

<p>“Paint, Varnish, Wall Paper,” announced the
sign. He pointed it out to the others, and after
dinner they delayed the voyage for the better
part of an hour while the name on the bow of the
boat was changed from <i>Jolly Roger</i> to <i>Slow Poke</i>.
Dick did the new lettering, and if it wasn’t exactly
perfect it, at least, answered its purpose.
In the course of the afternoon they were forced to
stop and take on gasolene, and Dick improved the
opportunity to lay in a new store of cylinder oil.
For the rest of that day, whenever he disappeared
they had only to peek in at the door of the engine-room
to find him spattering oil lovingly and enthusiastically
over the engine and adjacent territory.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that I mind the expense so much,”
muttered Chub, “but I hate to think what would
happen if any one carelessly dropped a match in
this part of the boat. She’s so saturated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
that smelly oil that she’d simply go up in a burst
of flame.”</p>

<p>“No engine will run smoothly without plenty of
oil,” grumbled Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect it to, Dickums, but there’s such
a thing as being overkind. Some morning you’ll
wake up and find that poor engine floating lifelessly
on a sea of cylinder oil. You’re simply
drowning it!”</p>

<p>The morning of the twenty-first found them
still some twenty miles below Ferry Hill and the
<i>Slow Poke</i> was put at her best pace in the hope
of reaching her destination by luncheon-time.
And she responded nobly to the demand, nosing
her way up to the boat-house landing at Ferry
Hill shortly before one o’clock.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>HARRY GOES TO SEA</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Back to the old home,” murmured Chub, as he
leaned over the railing of the upper deck
and let his gaze travel over the scene before him.
Beside the landing at the right was the boat-house;
to the left, the little stretch of white beach;
before him, the winding path leading upward
through a thick grove of rustling trees. Afar
up on the hill, the tower of School Hall showed
above the tree-tops. Roy, on the float, took a
final hitch in the bow line, straightened himself,
and looked about.</p>

<p>“Things haven’t changed much, have they?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Can’t expect them to, in less than a year,” answered
Chub.</p>

<p>“There’s Hammond over there,” muttered Roy,
shading his eyes and looking across the glittering
river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, that’s just where we left it,” laughed
Chub. “And Harry’s Island is in the same place,
too, strange as it may seem. And the river still
flows to the south, and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Roy. “But I don’t think much
of the welcome they’ve provided, do you?”</p>

<p>“I do not,” answered Chub, with emphasis.
“I expected at least a brass band and a collation.”</p>

<p>“Bother the brass band,” said Dick, appearing
from the engine-room wiping his oil-stained hands
on a piece of waste. “But a collation has a cheerful
sound.”</p>

<p>“I thought surely that Harry would be here,”
said Roy, with a trace of disappointment. “I
wonder if she’s back.” He looked up the path.</p>

<p>“Maybe she didn’t get that letter,” suggested
Dick. “If she didn’t she wouldn’t know when
to look for us. And here we have invited ourselves
to luncheon!”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” inquired Chub, “we posted that
letter at the hotel, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Dick. “Roy wrote it
that afternoon; don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“I remember his writing it,” said Chub, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
I never saw it afterward. Did you mail it at the
office, Roy?”</p>

<p>“Yes—er—I guess so. I put it in my pocket
when we went to dinner.”</p>

<p>“Ten to one, you didn’t mail it!” exclaimed
Dick.</p>

<p>“Suppose you look in your pocket,” Chub suggested.
Roy walked into the forward cabin with
a frown on his face. Chub and Dick grinned
across at each other. In a moment Roy returned
with the letter in his hand and looking very
sheepish.</p>

<p>“It was in the pocket of my blue serge,” he
announced. The others looked disgusted.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice one!” exclaimed Chub. “Here
we are with nothing on board for luncheon and no
one to invite us to the Cottage.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” muttered Roy. “I don’t
know how I came to forget it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s bacon and potatoes, isn’t
there?” he added with an attempt at cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“Bacon and potatoes!” growled Chub. “I’m
sick of bacon and potatoes!”</p>

<p>“And I’m sick of cooking ’em!” added Dick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
“I thought we were going to get a good luncheon
at the Cottage.”</p>

<p>“Well, why not go up and call on the Doctor
and Mrs. Emery?” asked Chub. “They’ll be certain
to ask us to lunch.”</p>

<p>“It looks too cheeky,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Think of your minding that!” murmured
Chub. Then, “I know!” he exclaimed. “We’ll
blow the whistle and maybe some one will come!”</p>

<p>“Good idea!” Dick cried. He darted into the
wheel-house and in a moment the whistle was
screeching loudly. “That ought to fetch some
one,” said he.</p>

<p><em>Toot-toot-! Toot-toot-toot!</em> said the whistle.
Dick kept up the racket for a full minute, and then
they awaited results. Several more minutes
passed.</p>

<p>“What time is it?” asked Dick. Chub looked
at his watch.</p>

<p>“Almost a quarter past one,” he replied.
“And they have luncheon at one.”</p>

<p>Dick groaned.</p>

<p>“Listen!” exclaimed Roy. From up the hill
came a faint shrill cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s Harry!” Chub exclaimed. He scrambled
down to the landing just as a white-clad figure
came into sight up the path.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!” she called, gleefully, using her
hands as a megaphone, and there was an answering
shout of joy in chorus from the boat. <a href="#i_p223">The
next moment they were all shaking hands</a> on the
landing, laughing and talking together in a babel
of sound.</p>

<p>“I thought you weren’t coming!” cried Harry.
“You promised to write and you never did it!”</p>

<p>Harriet Emery, or Harry, as she preferred to
be called, was the daughter of Doctor Emery, the
Principal of Ferry Hill School. She was sixteen
years of age, or would be very shortly, and a
charming girl. She had pronouncedly red hair
of a very pretty shade, a pair of sparkling blue
eyes, a somewhat pert, little, uptilted nose, and a
complexion which, in spite of the coat of tan which
was beginning to overspread it was very attractive.</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly have grown!” exclaimed
Chub, backing off that he might get the full effect
of the graceful figure in its white dress. “Skirts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
down and hair up,” he added with a shake of his
head. “Harry, you must come to Class Day next
year. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Do you really think I’ve grown?” she asked,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Grown!” echoed Roy. “You look a whole
foot taller!”</p>

<p>“That’s because she wears her hair that way,”
said Dick.</p>

<p>“Dick Somes, it is not!” Harry turned upon
him indignantly.</p>

<p>“Dick Somes, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!”
mimicked Chub. “Don’t you mind him,
Harry. He never did have any manners in spite
of my careful training. We were beginning to
think you weren’t here, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know when you were coming, silly!
Why didn’t you write? I’ve been awfully anxious.”</p>

<p>“Write? Oh, but we <em>did</em> write,” said Chub.
“Didn’t you get Roy’s letter?”</p>

<p>“Of course I didn’t,” replied Harry, suspiciously,
glancing around her at the preternaturally
sober countenances. “I don’t believe you
wrote.”</p>

<p>“How passing strange!” murmured Chub.
“Roy, hand the lady her letter. She appears to
doubt my word.”</p>

<p>Roy laughed, and fished the missive from his
pocket.</p>

<p>“You didn’t send it!” Harry exclaimed. Chub
shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, we feared it might alarm you. We
thought it better to bring it along with us. You
will see that we agreed to be here the twenty-first.
It is now the twenty-first. And here we are, right
on time. Punctuality is one of our principal virtues.
Tell her some of the others, Dick.”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” owned Roy, “that I forgot to
mail it, Harry. I’m awfully sorry, really.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter now that you’re here,
does it?” asked Harry, beamingly. “And doesn’t
the <i>Jolly Roger</i> look beautiful?”</p>

<p>“She is no longer the <i>Jolly Roger</i>,” corrected
Chub. “We have changed the name to <i>Slow
Poke</i>. After you’ve been on her awhile you’ll
know why. But she does pretty well. I take
very good care of her. Of course, if I had a capable,
intelligent crew, I might do much better,
but—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“Chub, you’re just as silly as ever!” said
Harry, severely. “I should think that going to
college would make you more sensible.”</p>

<p>“It will take more than a year to affect him
that way,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad to see you all!” exclaimed
Harry, beaming from one to another of the trio.
“But we must hurry back because luncheon is on
the table and I told mama I’d bring you right up.”</p>

<p>The boys gazed at each other and smiled covertly.
Chub shook his head regretfully.</p>

<p>“It’s very nice of you, Miss Emery, and we appreciate
your thoughtfulness, but the fact is that
Dick had just announced dinner when you appeared.
So I think we had better decline your
invitation.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s perfectly horrid!” cried Harry in
disappointment. “<em>Please</em> come, Chub!”</p>

<p>Chub hesitated, frowning tensely. Dick and
Roy grinned. At length—</p>

<p>“Very well, if you put it that way,” acceded
Chub. “I never could refuse a lady. We will
go, even against our inclinations. Dick, clear the
viands from the board.”</p>

<p>Dick and Roy burst into laughter, while Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
looked perplexedly from them to Chub’s grave
countenance.</p>

<p>“There aren’t any viands,” blurted Dick.
“We haven’t anything but bacon and potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Harry. “Chub Eaton, you’re a
dreadful fibber! It would just serve you right
if I—if I recalled my invitation.”</p>

<p>“Jehoshaphat!” shrieked Chub, leaping up the
path. “I won’t give you a chance! I’ll tell your
mother you’ll be right up.” They heard him
scrambling up through the grove ahead of them.
But when they reached the gate in the hedge which
divided the school grounds from the woods Chub
was awaiting them. “We will all go in together,”
he announced with dignity. “It will look much
better.”</p>

<p>So they went across to the doctor’s residence,
mounted the steps, and found themselves in the
little parlor shaking hands with Doctor and Mrs.
Emery and the latter’s sister, who was to remain
at the Cottage during the absence of Harry and
her father.</p>

<p>Chub and Roy and Dick had been quite intimate
with the doctor and his wife during their school
years, and the latter were unmistakably glad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
see them again. Luncheon was ready and they
all trooped into the dining-room. Of course,
there was much to tell and the doctor asked a good
many questions of Chub and Roy regarding their
college experience. Afterward the conversation
worked around to the cruise, and Chub recounted
their adventures up to date, winning more than
one hearty laugh from his audience. Mrs. Emery
wanted them to bring their luggage ashore and
occupy beds in one of the dormitories during their
stay at Ferry Hill, but they declined the invitation,
electing to stand by their ship. It was
agreed that the <i>Slow Poke</i> was to remain at Ferry
Hill two days. Then the Doctor and Harry were
to go aboard, and the cruise was to continue up
the river. There was only one dissenting voice,
and that was Dick’s.</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” he said, “we ought to turn
around and go down stream a while. The <i>Slow
Poke’s</i> been tussling with the current ever since
we started. We ought to give her a rest and let
her float with the tide for a while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks,” Chub objected, “put some more
oil on the engine, Dickums. What’s the good of
going over the same ground—I mean the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
water—twice? Let’s discover new worlds.”</p>

<p>So the majority had its way, as it usually does,
and the <i>Slow Poke</i> was slated for a fortnight’s
trip up the river and back again.</p>

<p>After dinner every one went down to the landing
and inspected the house-boat, Roy murmuring
excuses for the untidiness of the rooms. Mrs.
Emery, however, declared that everything looked
very neat, and that she rather wished she were
going, too. Whereupon Chub gallantly offered to
sleep on deck.</p>

<p>“What a dear little room!” Harry exclaimed
when her room on the boat was shown her. “It’s
perfectly lovely!” Her father’s room adjoined it
and he, too, was delighted. The three boys
“bunked” together in the rear room.</p>

<p>Roy hurried in to summon Dick to his duties
as engineer, as the ladies wanted to go for a sail.
The <i>Slow Poke</i> meandered up the river for a
couple of miles and the guests sat on the upper
deck and said all sorts of nice things about her
and her crew. Harry was allowed to take the
wheel for a while, under Chub’s tutelage, and was
highly pleased.</p>

<p>The boys remained at the school two days, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
which time they went to all their old haunts,
played a good deal of tennis, and had a thoroughly
enjoyable time of it. They spent an afternoon on
Harry’s Island, which lay in the river just above
the school, and talked over the fun they had had
the summer before while camping out there. The
island had been a birthday present to Harry from
her father, and she was very proud of it.</p>

<p>“When I get through college,” she declared,
“I’m going to build a house here and live in it
all my days. Won’t that be jolly?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” said Dick, “you’ll get married and
maybe live a thousand miles from here.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t,” answered Harry, seriously. “I’ve
decided not to be married, ever. I told Aunt Harriet
so the other day and she said I was very sensible.”</p>

<p>They visited Harry’s menagerie in the barn
and renewed acquaintances with Methuselah, the
parrot, several Angora cats and kittens, squirrels,
guinea-pigs, rabbits, white mice and pigeons.
[Snip, Harry’s fox-terrier had long since welcomed
them.] Methuselah looked not a whit different
from what he did when they had last seen
him, and, although it is doubtful if he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
even Dick, he acted quite cordially and nipped
Roy’s finger in quite an intimate manner.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” asked Harry, anxiously, “that
Snip would be in the way on the boat?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” answered Chub. “We’re going
to take him along, aren’t we, Snip?” And
Snip wagged his stump of a tail in enthusiastic
affirmation.</p>

<p>They were to leave in the morning, and Harry
spent most of that afternoon in the kitchen making
pies and doughnuts, Mrs. Emery assisting. Chub,
being missed from the tennis court, was discovered
sitting on the kitchen doorsteps sampling
the baking.</p>

<p>“How many has he had, Mrs. Emery?” Roy
demanded.</p>

<p>“Only one or two, haven’t I, Mrs. Emery?”
cried Chub.</p>

<p>“Well, not very many,” responded that lady
smilingly.</p>

<p>“Chub Eaton, you’ve had four to my certain
knowledge!” exclaimed Harry, who, with a blue-checked
apron tied under her chin and very
flushed cheeks, was superintending the frying of
a new batch of doughnuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you’ve had quite enough,” said Roy
firmly. “And it’s back to tennis court for you,
Chub.”</p>

<p>However, they postponed the carrying out of
the verdict long enough to do some sampling themselves.
“They’re perfect,” was Dick’s verdict,
“but I miss the almond flavor, Harry.” Whereupon
Harry grew very much redder and it was
discovered that her mother had never learned of
her experiment in adding almond extract to the
doughnut recipe the summer before. So Chub
told about it and Harry declared that he was too
mean for words and shouldn’t have another bite
of anything.</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast the luggage
was taken aboard, the doctor’s being largely composed
of books and papers, and at ten o’clock all
hands were at the landing, Snip being so excited
that he was obliged to bark every instant. Doctor
Emery pretended that the voyage was to last for
months at least and was very solicitous as to the
state of the larder. Mrs. Emery, her sister, and
John, the gardener and general factotum, were on
hand to witness the departure and to wave good-by
as the <i>Slow Poke</i> nosed her way free of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
landing and started off on the second stage of her
voyage.</p>

<p>“Good-by, mama!” called Harry from the upper
deck, waving a wisp of a handkerchief frantically.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” called Mrs. Emery. “Don’t fall
overboard!”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised Harry, earnestly.</p>

<p>And then caps and handkerchiefs waved busily
until the <i>Slow Poke</i> passed around the end of
Harry’s Island and the landing disappeared from
view.</p>

<p>“And now,” cried Harry, ecstatically, “we’re
really at sea!”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Three idyllic days followed during which the
<i>Slow Poke</i>, her white paint freshly gleaming
in the sunlight, bobbed and courtesied her way
up the long reaches of the river. It was wonderful
weather for July, pleasantly cool in the mornings
and evenings and languorously hot in the
middle of the day. Chub still remained nominally
master of the ship, but to all intents and purposes
the management of affairs had passed into the
small, sun-browned hands of Miss Harriet Emery.
It was Harry who ordered the lines cast off as
soon as breakfast was finished in the morning and
who refused to allow them to remain at anchor
for more than the barest two hours at dinner-time.
Chub predicted sunstrokes for the whole
party, but Harry was without mercy. She was
on a cruise and her idea of cruising was to keep
going. On the second evening she even insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
that they should leave a very comfortable berth
and put in two hours of sailing by moonlight. It
proved a very pleasant experience, and every one
enjoyed it until it became necessary to find a place
to spend the night. Then, as the shore was in
deep shadow, they had their own troubles with
jutting rocks and submerged tree-trunks.</p>

<p>Doctor Emery spent most of his time on the
upper deck, reading in the numerous books he
had brought; writing on square sheets of paper,
and, sometimes, sitting idly in his chair and watching
the shore slip by. But he always had a ready
smile for whoever happened by, and, on the whole,
was quite the cheeriest and most contented of
any. The upper deck was a mighty comfortable
place in the middle of the day when, moored or
anchored by the river bank, they ate dinner and
indulged afterward in what they called a “siesta.”
The table was set up there, and, while it was
somewhat of a trouble to bring the things up the
stairs, it made a fine dining-room. The striped
awning fluttered in the breeze, the geraniums were
masses of scarlet bloom and the gaily-hued rugs
added their quota of color. There were wicker
chairs for all, although Dick preferred to lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
stretched out on the deck with a cushion under
his head. Sometimes during siesta the Doctor
fell frankly asleep and snored gently, and the
others talked in whispers for fear of awaking
him. But Harry was impatient of idleness, and
as soon as the two hours were up she insisted
on weighing anchor.</p>

<p>Snip would scamper ashore whenever they
touched the bank and he had the most wonderfully
exciting times of his life. He explored every foot
of the ground, pursued real and imaginary scents,
and treed mythical bears. Those three days were
jolly ones, even if nothing really happened.
There was so much to talk about, so many things
to relate, that the conversation never languished
for a minute. Harry learned to steer after a fashion,
learned to tell time by the ship’s clock in the
wheel-house, and helped Dick prepare the meals.
She made the beds, too, and went religiously
around the rooms with a dustcloth every morning
in a vain endeavor to find dust.</p>

<p>But on the fourth day Harry’s mania for progress
palled. It was a gray morning, foggy and
damp. Oddly enough it was the Doctor who first
voiced a desire for change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder,” he remarked, looking at the unbroken
margin of forest which stretched along
the shore, “if there is any fishing to be found
about here?”</p>

<p>“I think we could catch something from the
tender, sir,” replied Roy.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of trout,” murmured the Doctor.
Chub went into the wheel-house and consulted
his map.</p>

<p>“There’s a good-sized stream about a mile up,”
he announced. “Let’s go and try it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s!” cried Harry. “I never caught a
trout.”</p>

<p>“You should have seen the one I caught,” said
Chub. “It was a regular whopper. It was as
long—”</p>

<p>Roy and Dick groaned.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a picture of it somewhere. I’ll find
it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind it now,” said Roy gently. “Try
to think of something else, Chub. You see, sir,”
addressing the Doctor, “he’s a little bit—er—daffy
on the subject of that fish. As a matter of
fact, it weighed about ten ounces and—”</p>

<p>“Ten ounces!” howled Chub. “It weighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
two pounds! Why, it was the biggest trout you
ever saw! I thought first it was a salmon.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we see if we can find another,” said
the Doctor with a smile. “I haven’t fished for
trout in years. Could I borrow a line from some
one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir: I’ve lots of them,” said Chub. “And
an extra pole. And Dick has a pole Harry can
use. Let’s take luncheon with us and make a day
of it.”</p>

<p>They did. The stream, which evaded them for
the better part of an hour, held plenty of small
trout and the Doctor was as excited as a boy over
his first catch. Harry didn’t make a good fisherman,
for she was too impatient. But they had a
good time, even when it drizzled for awhile, and
ate their luncheon at noon huddled together in
the lee of a big boulder. They returned to the
boat in the middle of the afternoon with seventeen
small trout. The sun came out soon afterward
and made a glorious ending to the day.
They fried the fish for supper and the Doctor, who
pretended to have personally caught all the largest
of the trout, declared that he had never tasted
anything finer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“We might try again some day,” he said tentatively.</p>

<p>The result was that the next morning they
chugged four miles further up the river, crossed
to the west bank and made a mooring in a particularly
attractive little cove. The stream which
they had come to fish in flowed into the cove under
a wooden bridge, and a few hundred yards below
was a small settlement consisting of a village
store and a half-dozen houses. Between the road
and the river was a small stretch of meadow on
one side and a grove of trees on the other.</p>

<p>“What an ideal place!” exclaimed Harry, as
she stepped ashore.</p>

<p>Strange to say, however, they appeared to have
alighted in a locality quite bare of streams and
lakes and nothing on the map looked enticing
nearer than a good-sized lake half a day’s journey
upstream and several miles back from the
river. They held a council and decided to try
their luck there, the Doctor declaring with enthusiasm
that a lake like that ought to have plenty
of black bass in it. Chub and Dick had never
fished for bass, and that was enough incentive for
them. The <i>Slow Poke</i> was put at her best pace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and they reached their destination that afternoon.
After supper the Doctor regaled them with stories
of bass fishing that made their hearts beat high
in anticipation of the morrow’s sport.</p>

<p>They were up early to secure a full morning’s
fishing. Everyone went, Snip showing more true
enthusiasm than any other member of the expedition.
The lake proved a long way off, the
road was very hot and very dusty, and after the
first mile Harry was trailing along in the rear,
with Chub gallantly bearing her company. They
were all tired out when they reached the lake
and the sight which greeted them there was far
from cheering. The lake was large enough, but
for fully half a mile around where they stood it
was so shallow that rushes grew for hundreds of
feet out into the water. The Doctor shook his
head dubiously.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look much like a bass lake,” he muttered,
“but we’ll walk along around that point
and see what’s there.”</p>

<p>They walked around that point and two more
before they found a semblance of deep water.
There was nothing in sight in the way of a boat
or raft, and at last they tried a few casts from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
bank and in the course of half an hour caught five
small fish which the Doctor said were crappies.
Whatever they were they were not worth carrying
home. The only catch of any importance was
made by Snip. He found a turtle on the bank and
worried it until it closed on his paw. His yelps
brought prompt assistance from Chub who pried
the turtle’s jaws apart and threw it into the lake.
Snip stood in the mud and barked for fully five
minutes at the place where the turtle had disappeared.
At noon they reeled in their lines,
packed their poles and went back to the boat,
reaching it just before two o’clock, too warm and
tired and disgusted to be hungry. They had a
cold luncheon instead of a dinner, and Harry
made some iced tea for which they sacrificed the
last piece of ice on board. After luncheon Chub
strode to the wheel-house and seized his chart
with an air of determination.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this place,” he said. “Let’s get
out of here as soon as we can.”</p>

<p>That evening they tied up to a little deserted
wharf a few miles below Albany, and in the morning
chugged on to the capital. They spent that
day ashore, shopping and sightseeing, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
dinner at a hotel. They bought gasolene and ice
and fresh meat and fruit and vegetables and what
Chub called “real milk.” They spent a very hot
night there, anchored in the river, and in the
morning went on northward until noon.</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of the river up here,” said
Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t anything to boast of,” Chub replied.
“If every one else is willing I say let’s
turn and go back.”</p>

<p>Everyone was quite willing and so after dinner
was over the boat was headed down-stream. The
next day found them moored at the foot of a
sloping pasture which ran back and up to a thick
forest. The pasture looked as though it might
contain berries, and Harry mentioned the fact.
Chub pointed out that whether there were berries
there or not there were certainly cows. But
Harry declared that she wasn’t afraid of any
number of cows and so, leaving the Doctor to keep
house, they took pails and buckets and set forth.
Harry had guessed right and they had no difficulty
in filling their pails with blackberries. There
were a few blueberries, too, and Roy had a brilliant
idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“Harry!” he called, “would you like to distinguish
yourself? I’ve enough blueberries here for
a nice big pie. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“She says yes!” cried Chub.</p>

<p>“I haven’t said anything,” Harry demurred.</p>

<p>“But you’re going to, aren’t you?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Do you really want a pie?”</p>

<p>“Want it! My soul craves a blueberry pie,
Harry!”</p>

<p>“All right; but if I’m to make it in time for
dinner we must go back at once. I do hope it
will be a success. I never tried baking in a tin
oven,” she added loftily.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Dick. “After you’ve
tried it once you’ll use no other. Isn’t it lucky
dinner is our midday meal!”</p>

<p>So they had blueberry pie that day, a good big
fat one it was, too. After a short siesta they
walked over to the pasture which afforded a fairly
good place for kicking and catching, and the boys
found the foot-ball which Chub had brought along
and had a good hour of fun with it. Snip, too,
enjoyed it, chasing the pigskin like a veteran and
trying to bite holes in it when he had run it down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry’s pie was such a success that there was
a loud and insistent demand for more. So she
tried one of blackberries and, while it wasn’t quite
as good as the blueberry, it didn’t go begging.</p>

<p>Two days of rain tried their patience, for the
upper deck was quite uninhabitable, and staying
indoors became dull work after the first few hours.
The evenings weren’t so bad, for Harry took
things in hand then. They had dancing to music
supplied by the talking-machine, they played
games and told stories, the Doctor proving a veritable
mine of romance. The <i>Slow Poke</i> made a
few miles each day, but most of the time it remained
huddled against a bank as much as possible
out of the way of the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246-<br />247]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day the storm passed over, but the
weather remained gloomy and chill. The <i>Slow
Poke</i> put thirty miles behind her between breakfast
and supper and life became more cheerful.
Just before sunset the clouds broke and a vivid
red glow in the northwest promised a fair day on
the morrow. That evening the Doctor began to
talk of trout again, and Chub brought his map
down to the table in the forward cabin and they
searched it for likely fishing places. The result
was that in the morning they chugged four miles
down stream, crossed over to the west shore, and
found a mooring in a charming little sandy cove.
The sky was blue again, the river like a great
mirror, and the sun shone hot and comforting.
The <i>Slow Poke</i> lay nestled right up to the bank
and a few yards away the stream which they had
come to fish in flowed into the cove under an old
rickety wooden bridge. Between the road and the
water was a grove of trees and a little clearing in
which the grass grew knee-deep. Some four hundred
yards down-stream huddled a small settlement
consisting of a store and a half-dozen white
and drab houses under a group of giant elms.</p>

<p>“What a lovely place for a camp,” mused
Harry, as the boat was made fast.</p>

<p>“Great!” Chub agreed. “Let’s pitch the tent,
fellows, and live ashore for a day or two. Doctor
Emery and Harry can stay aboard at night and
guard the boat.”</p>

<p>The proposition was received with enthusiasm,
and <a href="#i_p245">before noon camp was made at the edge of
the grove</a> and Dick was cooking dinner over an
open fire. They ate the last of the doughnuts
at that meal and Chub was inconsolable until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Harry promised to make some more as soon as she
could secure the necessary ingredients and a kettle
big enough in which to fry them.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can get things at the store down
there,” said Chub. “I’ll go and see presently.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>MRS. URIAH PEEL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The Doctor, Roy, and Dick went up the stream
in search of trout, Snip accompanying them,
but Chub and Harry elected to stay behind and
go shopping. And after the others had taken their
departure with poles and tackle they set off for
the store. The road ambled across the old wooden
bridge, climbed a little hill between high thickets
of sumac, and dipped again toward the settlement.
From the slope, as they trudged along, they had
a view of a wide expanse of farms and orchards
with here and there a snug farm-house nestling
under its grove of trees. The village, if it really
deserved the name, consisted by actual count of
seven dwelling-houses and the store. The road
they were on continued along the river, while a
second road turned from it at right angle in front
of the store and wound inland. It was a sleepy
little hamlet and the only persons in sight as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
reached the corner were an old man half asleep
on the tiny porch of a neighboring house and an
elderly woman pottering about the garden of
another. There was a watering-trough at the
edge of the street and three big elms threw a
grateful shade over the place.</p>

<p>The store was a one-story affair and at some
time in its history had been painted white. At
the back a small ell with a side door was evidently
the residence of the storekeeper. A brick path
led to it between a bed of sweet-william and a row
of tall lilac bushes, to which still clung the brown
and withered flower spikes. The elms bathed the
red brick sidewalk, broken and uneven, and the
front of the store in cool green shadow. Above
the narrow doorway, was an ancient sign which
proclaimed that “Uriah Peel” dealt in “General
Merchandise.” On each side of the door was a
shallow bay-window fitted with shelves on which
was displayed as heterogeneous a collection of articles
as ever came together: pickles, cough syrup,
carpet tacks, a jar of stick candy, flatirons, horse
liniment, toys, a few paper-covered books, a box
of files, women’s shoes, a manicure set in a purple
plush case, straw hats, an assortment of ribbons,
tin stew-pans and dippers, and a host of other
things.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252-<br />253]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t find anything here that we want,”
muttered Chub at the door.</p>

<p>As the door swung open there was a distant
tinkling of a bell. The store was empty when they
entered, empty and dim and cool after the sunny
road; but in response to the summons of the bell
a little woman appeared at the back, entering apparently
from the ell. She was one of the tiniest
women they had ever seen, and as she hurried toward
them <a href="#Page_251">she tied together the strings of a quaint
little black bonnet</a>.</p>

<p>“How do you do,” said Harry. “We want to
buy an iron kettle if you have one.”</p>

<p>“An iron kettle,” mused the little woman, taking
her chin in her hand and looking anxiously
about her. “Did you want a very large one?”</p>

<p>She seemed to be about fifty years of age, with
a thin comely face and a pleasant voice. Her
expression, however, was so troubled and excited
that Chub wondered, and Harry hurriedly assured
her that just a medium-sized one would do and
that if she didn’t have it it didn’t really matter
one bit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have some kettles somewhere,” answered
the little woman in a flurry, “only I don’t just remember—”</p>

<p>Then she darted behind one of the counters and
disappeared from sight while a rattling sound told
of frantic search. Harry turned bewilderedly to
Chub, and the latter grinned and tapped his forehead
eloquently.</p>

<p>“I thought so!” The storekeeper was beaming
triumphantly at them across the counter and holding
out a very dusty and somewhat rusty iron
kettle. It was just what they wanted, Harry declared.</p>

<p>“How much is it, please?”</p>

<p>The little woman turned it bottom up and
squinted closely, at last holding it out for their
inspection.</p>

<p>“Can you see any figures there?” she asked.
“I left my spectacles in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Looks like $7.00,” replied Chub dubiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, then it’s seventy cents,” was the reply.
“Uriah always made a cent mark like an ought.
Was there anything else, Miss?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harry, hesitatingly, “we did want
some lard and flour, but—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“How much lard?”</p>

<p>“Have you a small pail of it?”</p>

<p>“No’m, I haven’t; but I can give you any
amount you want. Three or four pounds, Miss?”</p>

<p>“About five, I guess. And have you flour?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>And she had sugar, too, and the purchasers began
to entertain a new respect for the dingy little
store.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t live around here,” asked
the storekeeper as she bustled excitedly about.</p>

<p>“No, we’re on a boat,” replied Chub.</p>

<p>“I want to know!” was the response. “There
was a man in here only last week who came in a
boat. He bought a good deal, too, but there was
some things he wanted I didn’t have. Would
you mind just looking out and seeing if there’s
a buggy outside?”</p>

<p>Chub obeyed and reported no buggy in sight.
The woman looked anxiously at an old clock and
sighed.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know whether I’m on my head
or my heels,” she said with a little apologetic
laugh. “I’m just upset to-day.”</p>

<p>They murmured inarticulate sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“I got a telegraph message from my brother-in-law
down to Myersville this morning saying
that my sister is real sick and asking me to come
down there. And so I’m going to take the four
o’clock train.” She glanced again at the clock
which said a few minutes before three. “Millie
never was very strong and I’m real worried about
her. Seems as though he wouldn’t have sent a
telegraph message if things wasn’t pretty bad,
don’t it? I packed my bag right up and wrote a
letter to my niece over in Byers to come and look
after the store while I’m gone, but I haven’t
seen sight of her yet. I thought she’d be along
on that two-twenty train and I sent the Hooper
boy down to the station to meet her, and he ain’t
back yet. And if he don’t come pretty soon he
won’t be in time to take me to the station. Though
I don’t know as I’d ought to leave the store
until Jennie comes.”</p>

<p>“Is your husband away?” ventured Chub sympathetically.</p>

<p>“He died a year ago last April.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Chub. “I’m very sorry.
I didn’t know—”</p>

<p>“Course you didn’t. I ain’t never had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
sign changed yet. Don’t know as I ever will. If
business don’t pick up pretty soon I guess I’ll
have to close up. Uriah used to do pretty well
here when he was alive, but there’s a new store
opened down to Washington Hills and folks
mostly goes there to buy their things. Is that the
buggy?”</p>

<p>“No,” Chub reported. “It hasn’t come yet.”</p>

<p>She looked again at the clock and heaved an
audible sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Well, everything’s all ready when it does
come,” she said. “I suppose you young folks
travel a good deal on the trains, but I never have,
and I’m always pretty nigh scared to death at the
thought of it. There’s always so many accidents
in the papers.”</p>

<p>“Have you far to go?” asked Harry. The purchases
were all ready and paid for by this time,
but neither Harry nor Chub seemed in any hurry
to depart.</p>

<p>“’Bout seventy miles it is. I have to take the
train to Jones Point and then the ferry across to
Peekskill. I guess I’ll find a carriage waiting
for me at the other side. Yes, it’s a good deal
of a journey. When Millie was first married it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
did seem like she was just going right out of the
world. But she’s been to see me plenty of times
since and I’ve been down to Myersville twice.
Millie was visiting me only a little while ago;
must be two weeks since she left. Maybe the
trip was too much for her. She ain’t as strong
as she used to be, and there’s a lot of work about
a farm. I guess James is a real good husband
to her, but he don’t seem to realize what a sight
of work she has to do. Men are like that—mostly.
I do wonder why that trifling boy don’t
come back?”</p>

<p>She hurried to the front door, opened it, and
looked anxiously out.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose he’ll get back when he’s good
and ready. I do hope Jennie can come. If she
doesn’t I’ll just have to shut up the store.
’Twon’t make much difference, though, I guess;
what’s sold here in two days wouldn’t pay Jennie’s
fare across. But I got everything ready if
she should come. I marked things plain so’s she
can tell how much to ask. I spent about three
hours doing it, too.”</p>

<p>She looked proudly about the store and Chub
and Harry, their gazes following hers, saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
almost everything in sight had been labeled in
some way with the price. Usually small paper
bags had been laid upon the article and the figures
printed on the bag.</p>

<p>“It must have been a lot of trouble,” murmured
Harry.</p>

<p>“So it was, but Jennie hasn’t got enough sense
to look after the place if things aren’t marked
right out plain. There he is, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>A buggy containing a small, freckled-faced boy
drew slowly up at the edge of the sidewalk in
front of the store. Mrs. Peel’s face fell.</p>

<p>“Jennie didn’t come!” she exclaimed. “Whatever
shall I do? I ought to be starting for the
station this very instant. I suppose she’s coming
on the next train, but I can’t wait for her.
I do think she might have come when I told her,
after all the things I’ve done for that girl! But
that’s the way of human nature, I suppose! Bennie
Hooper, didn’t you see anything of her?”</p>

<p>“No’m,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“You sure she didn’t get off and you didn’t
see her?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t nobody get off,” answered Benny resentfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well—” Mrs. Peel’s eyes wavered back and
forth from the clock to the buggy. “I suppose
I’ll just have to shut up the store and leave the
key with Martha Hooper. Mrs. Benson was coming
in for some onions, but I suppose she’ll have
to wait.”</p>

<p>“When does the next train come?” asked Harry
solicitously.</p>

<p>“About six. She’s bound to come on that,
but—”</p>

<p>“Then you let us watch the store until she
comes,” cried Harry. “We’ll be very careful,
Mrs. Peel. That is, if you think you’d care to
trust us?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peel’s face had lighted at once.</p>

<p>“You—you wouldn’t mind?” she faltered anxiously.
“Jennie’s bound to come on the six
o’clock train and I’ll have Bennie wait over there
and bring her back. She ought to be here by half-past
six. It’s a good deal to ask, especially as
you’re strangers to me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be glad to,” answered Harry promptly.
“Won’t we, Chub?” Chub agreed readily.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how to thank you,” fluttered
Mrs. Peel. “I just don’t, and that’s a fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
But I’m going to take you at your word. All
you’ll have to do is to stay here until she comes
and tell her everything’s marked with the price,
and that I’ll be back just as soon as I can and
will write to-morrow and tell her how Millie is.
Now I’ll get my things. You turn that buggy
around, Bennie; you know I don’t like to be in
it when it’s turned.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peel shot a rapid look at the clock and hurried
away to the little door leading to the living-rooms.
When she came back Chub took the old
black leather bag from her and put it in the buggy.
By this time the little woman’s excitement was
intense.</p>

<p>“Tell Jennie the house door is locked on the
inside and that she’s to be careful to look out
for sparks when she goes to bed because the insurance
has run out and I haven’t had time to
renew it again. And if Mrs. Benson comes for
the onions you see that she pays for ’em, because
she owes me two dollars and eighteen cents already.
I didn’t leave any money in the till because
I had to have it to buy my ticket, but I
guess she’ll have the right change. I’m very
much obliged to you, young lady, and you, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
And I hope you’ll be here when I get back. Benny,
you’ve got your reins crossed; I do wish
you’d be a little careful when you know how
nervous I am about horses. Did I get my spectacles?
Yes, here they are. Go ahead, Bennie, and
drive careful. Good-by, Miss! Good-by, sir!
Tell Jennie I’ll write to-morrow surely. If you
like candy there’s some in the jars on the shelf
back of the counter on the left. Help yourself,
Miss. Good-by! Bennie, I guess you’ll have to
hurry a little.”</p>

<p>“Got most forty minutes,” growled Bennie.</p>

<p>“Well, I like to be in plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“It don’t take but fifteen minutes,” said Bennie.
“Get ap, Cæsar!”</p>

<p>The buggy wobbled around the corner, Mrs.
Peel waving an excited black-mittened hand to
the two on the sidewalk, and disappeared. Chub
and Harry looked at each other and laughed.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a dear!” gasped Harry.</p>

<p>“Funniest ever. Let’s go in and look around
the shop.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>KEEPING STORE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was a queer little store. There was a window
on each side of the front door, a window
which peeped out onto the tiny side yard and the
brick walk, and the sweet-williams, and a window
directly opposite which, had the shutters been
open, would have given a view of the houses
across the road and the river beyond. At the
back of the store was a door which led into a
good-sized yard extending along the backs of the
store and the living house. There were a few
bedraggled shrubs here and a row of hollyhocks
nodded along a stretch of the high board fence
which inclosed the space. A door in the fence,
securely padlocked, led onto the road. For the
most part the back yard was given over to barrels
and packing cases, but in one corner a tiny shed
housed two green tanks labeled respectively
“Gasolene” and “Kerosine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>From the store to the dwelling-house the way
led up a step and through a door near the back
of the store. This door was open and Chub and
Harry allowed themselves a glimpse of a narrow
and dim hallway with a door at the far end. But
this was not their territory and they didn’t intrude.
Besides, there was plenty to see in the
shop part.</p>

<p>There was a wooden counter along each side
on which rested here and there funny old-fashioned
show-cases with mirrors at their backs.
One case held pocket-knives sitting enticingly on
their little green boxes, fish-hooks, lead sinkers,
a solitary pair of pruning-shears, a horn-handled
carving-knife and fork, scissors, thimbles, and
knitting-needles. Another case showed ribbons,
lace, edgings, and similar goods. Back of the
counters there were narrow aisles, and beyond the
aisles were shelves. On these were dry goods,
groceries, patent medicines, cheap straw hats and
woolen caps, overalls and jumpers, tinware, woodenware,
and crockery. Down the center of the
store, between the two counters, leaving an aisle
on either side, stood barrels and boxes, tubs and
pails, plowshares and bags of fertilizer, rakes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
hoes and shovels and brooms, bristling from otherwise
empty barrels, and potatoes and onions.
There were jars of striped pink and white candy
on the shelves and in the window, a few toys—paper
kites, marbles, and tops scattered around in
various places and—oh, heaps of other things
besides.</p>

<p>“Talk about your department stores!” exclaimed
Chub. “Isn’t this palatial!”</p>

<p>“She said we might have some candy,” said
Harry, standing on tiptoe and looking dubiously
into one of the jars, “but I don’t believe it is
very nice, do you?”</p>

<p>“I do not!” replied Chub decisively. “But, I
think I’ll buy a pair of these beautiful brown
overalls for Dick. He’s got oil and grease on
every pair of trousers he has with him. He’d
look perfectly swell in them, wouldn’t he?” And
Chub held up the garments in question. They
looked at least six feet long and correspondingly
broad, and Harry giggled as she mentally pictured
Dick in them.</p>

<p>“Chub, you must fold them up nicely again,”
she commanded, “and put them back just where
you found them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” Chub responded. “I’m
the neat little storekeeper, I am.” He continued
his investigations, peering into boxes and barrels
and having a thoroughly enjoyable time. “Harry,
here’s some real old-style brown sugar like
grandmother used to have; remember it? It’s
great! Have some?”</p>

<p>Harry had some, nibbling it out of the little tin
scoop.</p>

<p>“But we must pay for it, Chub,” she said anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll take this instead of the candy,”
Chub replied. “And look here, here’s some dried
apricots. My, but I’m glad I came!”</p>

<p>“Chub, you mustn’t take things!” cried
Harry.</p>

<p>“What, just a few old apricots?”</p>

<p>“No, not unless you pay for them.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Chub with a grin. Harry
examined the end of the box.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re fifteen cents a pound. How
many did you take?”</p>

<p>“Six.”</p>

<p>“Then I should think you ought to pay about a
cent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well.” Chub fished in his pocket and
found the required sum. “What do I do with
it?”</p>

<p>“Put it in the till. And we’ll keep a record
of everything that’s sold.” Harry found a paper
bag and a pencil and wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noic">“Six Dried Apricots      $ .01”<br /></p>
</div>

<p>“There now, that’s very businesslike, isn’t
it?” she asked. “We’ll put down everything we
sell.”</p>

<p>“I think it won’t be much trouble,” Chub answered
as he pulled open the little till drawer
under the counter and dropped his penny in.
“We may be the only ones to buy anything. I
wonder if she has any prunes.”</p>

<p>He went on with his investigation and Harry
wandered back to the front of the store. When
Chub joined her a few minutes later she was
seated in one of the two old arm-chairs which
stood by the open door deeply immersed in a
book.</p>

<p>“What you got?” asked Chub, looking over
her shoulder. “My! ‘Little Goldie’s Vow!’
Where’d you get it? Is it good?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fine! I found it in the window. There are
some more there. It’s awfully exciting.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” replied Chub, “but I don’t believe
I ought to let you read such things, Harry.
That’s just trash.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t read it,” answered Harry rebelliously.</p>

<p>“I don’t need to; the title’s enough. You
know your mother wouldn’t want you to read
such things.”</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Harry. “But please mayn’t
I just finish this chapter, Chub? It’s all about a
beautiful girl named Jessica and—”</p>

<p>“Thought her name was Little Goldie,” sniffed
Chub.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just a nickname that the hero gave
her on account of her wonderful golden tresses.
And there’s another girl in it named Alice; she’s
the villain—no, villainess—and a perfectly fascinating
man with beautiful gray eyes and—”</p>

<p>“What’s his name? Tom?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” exclaimed Harry contemptuously.
“His name is Reginald Forrest. At least,
that’s what he calls himself, but of course he’s
an earl or a lord or something in disguise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“Oh, they always are.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Seems to me you know a good deal
about novels, young lady!”</p>

<p>Harry looked a trifle embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Well, sometimes—at school—the girls would
bring them to read at recess,” she explained,
“and I borrowed one once—”</p>

<p>“Once?” demanded Chub sternly.</p>

<p>“Once or twice,” laughed Harry.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you have a very bad taste for literature,”
said Chub severely. “And I don’t
believe I ought to let you go on. I’ll have another
look for the prunes.” But his search was
unsuccessful and presently he was back at the
doorway. Harry was still deeply absorbed, and
so for awhile Chub studied the landscape. But
there wasn’t much to see until, after awhile, a
woman in a brown calico dress turned the corner
and came toward him.</p>

<p>“Look out, Harry!” he whispered. “Here’s
a customer!”</p>

<p>The woman, who had a very unattractive aspect,
glanced at Chub curiously and walked past him
into the store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’s Mrs. Peel?” she demanded of
Harry.</p>

<p>“She’s gone away to visit her sister, who is ill
at—at somewhere down the river. She’s left us
in charge of the store until her niece comes. Can
I do anything for you?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said the woman. “She always was
crazy. Well, I want two quarts of onions, but I
guess I can get them myself, young lady.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Chub will serve you,” said Harry, sweetly.
“Chub, please measure two quarts of onions
for this lady.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” replied Chub. He got a paper
sack and found the wooden measure. “Two
quarts, madam?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” replied the woman,
sourly. “And I don’t want all the little runts
there are, either. Mr. Benson said last week that
he never seen meaner-lookin’ onions than what I
got here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think these will suit you,” said Chub,
filling the measure. “Let me see now.” Chub
studied the figures on the paper bag which lay on
top of the basket. “Two quarts will be sixty
cents, madam.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sixty cents!” almost shrieked the woman.
“You must be crazy. I never paid more than
five cents a quart in all my born days!”</p>

<p>Chub looked inquiringly at Harry.</p>

<p>“What is the price on them, Chub?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It says thirty cents, and two quarts at thirty
cents—”</p>

<p>“Thirty cents a peck, you stupid!” said the
woman.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t say so,” Chub demurred doubtfully.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t say whether they’re thirty cents
a pint or thirty cents a bushel,” answered the
customer, acidly, “but onions are always sold by
the peck.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you’re right,” said Chub. “So
if you’ll take a peck we’ll call it thirty cents—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want a peck. Who ever heard of any
one buying a whole peck of onions at once?”</p>

<p>“But you just said that they are always sold
by the peck, and if that’s so—”</p>

<p>“I meant they were always <em>priced</em> by the peck,
and if you had the sense of a goose you’d know
something about it!”</p>

<p>“I think she must be right, Chub,” observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Harry. “Thirty cents sounds an awful lot for
onions.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right,” answered Chub, cheerfully.
“Thirty cents a peck it is, Mrs. Bronson.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Benson,” replied the woman,
tartly. “I hope for Mrs. Peel’s sake that her
niece will come soon.” She held out her hand
for the onions. “These go down to my account.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” returned Chub, “but Mrs. Peel told
us explicitly to sell only for cash.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you I have my things charged!”
said the customer, warmly.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it, madam, but as Mrs. Peel
would prefer to have the money, I’ll have to do
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never heard of anything so idiotic!
You give me those onions, or I’ll send Mr. Benson
over here to talk to you, you young jackanapes.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to hear Mr. Benson if
he talks interestingly,” replied Chub, sweetly.
“But if he wants the onions he will have to bring
eight cents with him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Benson looked wrathfully from Chub to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the bag of onions and wrathfully from the bag of
onions to Harry.</p>

<p>“You ain’t going to let me have them?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to, if you’ll pay cash,” replied
Chub. “But Mrs. Peel, I am sure—”</p>

<p>“She’ll rue the day she left you young ninnies
in charge here,” interrupted Mrs. Benson, as she
flung herself out of the store. “I was never so
insulted in all my born days! You wait until
Mr. Benson hears of this! You just wait!”</p>

<p>“Phew!” breathed Chub, as he set the bag of
onions down. “She has a horrid disposition,
hasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Harry, uneasily, “we ought to
have let her have them. We wouldn’t want Mrs.
Peel to lose a customer, would we?”</p>

<p>“The loss of that sort of a customer wouldn’t
hurt much,” returned Chub. “Too bad we
couldn’t make a sale, though. That cash drawer
looks mighty empty. Hello! there goes an automobile.
Did you see it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you—do you suppose she’ll send
her husband over?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can’t say,” answered Chub, carelessly.</p>

<p>“But he might be angry and make trouble.”</p>

<p>“Let him try it,” said Chub, grimly. “I’ll
take care of him if he tries to make a fuss.”</p>

<p>At that moment a form appeared at the door.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s Mr. Benson,” muttered Chub, as
he strolled to meet him.</p>

<p>The newcomer was a little wisp of a man, with a
nervous smile and a diffident manner and a thin,
high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said Chub, affably.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, sir, good afternoon,”
squeaked Mr. Benson. “Nice weather for the
time of year.”</p>

<p>“Some of the best,” answered Chub, cheerfully.
“Can I do anything for you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Er—if you please. My wife sent me over
for—for two quarts of onions. She—she was
over awhile back and didn’t have the money with
her.” He placed eight cents on the counter and
smiled ingratiatingly, rubbing his hands nervously
together.</p>

<p>“Right here,” said Chub, handing him the bag.
“Eight cents; quite correct, thank you. Nothing
else to-day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“N-nothing else, thank you. Good afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Benson.”</p>

<p>When he had gone, Chub sank into a chair and
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“He leads a merry life, Harry,” he gasped.
“Wouldn’t I just love to be Mrs. Benson’s husband!”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad to laugh at him,” replied Harry,
suppressing her own smiles. “He looked like a
very nice old man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I wouldn’t be in his boots for a fortune.
Let’s put the money away. That’s sale
number two. At this rate we’ll make Mrs. Peel
rich before Jennie comes.”</p>

<p>Harry deposited the coins in the till and made
another entry on her record:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noic">2 quarts of onions      .08<br /></p>
</div>

<p>Then she went back to her book, and Chub took
the chair at the other side of the open door and
watched her a while. Presently, “I say, Harry,”
he asked, “what’s the price of that book?”</p>

<p>“Ten cents,” she answered, glancing at the
cover.</p>

<p>“Are you going to read it through?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I don’t know. Do you think I oughtn’t
to, Chub?”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself,” answered Chub, with a shrug
of his shoulders. “I was just wondering whether
you could afford to read it.”</p>

<p>“Afford to?” asked Harry. “What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a ten-cent book, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed. “Do you think I ought
to pay for it?”</p>

<p>“Why not? You’re getting the use of it,
aren’t you? It’s just the same as though you
took it away with you.”</p>

<p>“Why, no, because I’ll put it back in the window
and Mrs. Peel can sell it again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if you took it you’d throw it away
after you were through with it. It isn’t any
good to you after you’ve read it, you see. How
much have you read so far?”</p>

<p>“Pretty nearly a third.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will call it three cents’ worth if you
stop now.”</p>

<p>“But—but I haven’t any money with me,
Chub!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I’ll lend it to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, couldn’t you—couldn’t you lend me
ten cents just as well?”</p>

<p>“No.” Chub shook his head. “I couldn’t
trust you for so much. If you read any more
you’ll have to go and get the money before Jennie
comes.”</p>

<p>“Chub, I think you’re just horrid!” cried Harry,
vexedly.</p>

<p>Chub only grinned. Harry looked hesitatingly
at the book for a moment, and then closed it regretfully
and placed it back in the window. Chub
counted out three coppers and dropped them into
her hand, and she placed them in the till. Then
she made another entry on the paper bag as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noic">One third of “Little Goldie’s Vow”      .03<br /></p>
</div>

<p>After that they drew their chairs to the doorway
and sat and looked out across the quiet,
shaded street.</p>

<p>There wasn’t much of interest to look at—a
cat washing its face on the side porch of the
little white house opposite, a sparkle of blue where
the river was visible between the branches of a
tree and the corner of a house on the other street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
a couple of pigeons parading about in the road.
Twice an old man went by trundling a wheelbarrow,
and twice automobiles flashed along
northward on the river road.</p>

<p>“Wonder what time it is,” murmured Chub
after a while, as he drew his watch out. “Hello,
almost six! I wonder if one of us hadn’t better
go back to the boat and tell the rest what’s happened
to us. Maybe they’ll be worried.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” said Harry. “And I’ll tell them
we can’t be back until half-past six, so that they
will keep supper for us.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Chub, “if you don’t
mind. I’ll keep store. When did she say that
train was due?”</p>

<p>“About six, I think. She said Jennie would
surely be here by half-past.”</p>

<p>“Well, only three-quarters of an hour more,
then. Run along and tell them. And you don’t
have to come back, Harry, unless you want to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I do! I won’t be more than ten minutes,
Chub.”</p>

<p>“Take your time,” answered Chub, magnanimously.
“I sha’n’t be overworked, I guess.”
He settled down comfortably in his chair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
watched Harry disappear around the corner.
“My, but this is an exciting town!” he muttered.
“I wish that cat would fall off the porch, or
something else would happen.” But nothing did,
and presently Harry was back again, and the
clock at the back of the store struck six in wheezy
tones. The sun was getting low, and long shafts
of amber light swept down the road that wound
up the hill toward the west. A train whistled in
the distance.</p>

<p>“That’s Jennie,” said Chub. “Bennie will
be along pretty soon now; Cæsar and Bennie and
Jennie. I’m getting awfully hungry. Do you
remember any of the messages Mrs. Peel left for
Jennie?”</p>

<p>Harry did, and to prove it she enumerated
them. Chub applauded her memory.</p>

<p>“All I remember,” he said, “was something
about sparks.”</p>

<p>It was almost twenty minutes later when the
white horse and the dilapidated buggy rattled
around the corner and pulled up for a moment in
front of the watering-trough. In the buggy sat
Bennie and no one else. He grinned joyously.</p>

<p>“She didn’t come,” he announced. “Get ap!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Chub, hurrying to the curb.
“Are you sure she wasn’t on the train?”</p>

<p>“Course I am.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she send any—any message or anything?”</p>

<p>“No, not that I know of.”</p>

<p>“When is the next train?”</p>

<p>“’Bout ’leven o’clock, I guess. Get ap.”</p>

<p>“Well, now what are we going to do?” demanded
Chub, as the white horse ambled away
again. Harry shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’d like to tell Jennie what I think of her,”
said Chub aggrievedly. “Nice way for her to
act. We can’t sit here until eleven o’clock and
wait for her. We’ll just have to shut up shop.”</p>

<p>“But how will she get into the house?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Chub frowned thoughtfully
at the crumbling bricks.</p>

<p>“I suppose we might leave the key across the
street and pin a note on the door telling her to
go there and get it. I guess that’s all we can do,
eh?”</p>

<p>Harry agreed that it was. So they saw to the
fastenings of the window, took their iron kettle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
into which were packed their other purchases,
wrote a line on a paper bag, and locked the door
behind them. Then Harry supplied a pin, and
Chub posted the note, which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Jennie</span>: The key to the store is at the white house
right across the street.</p>
</div>

<p>At the white house they had some difficulty in
explaining their errand to an elderly woman who
was very deaf and very suspicious, but finally they
accomplished it and went off, leaving the key in
her hands.</p>

<p>“There’s a chance that Jennie won’t be able
to make that old woman understand what she
wants,” growled Chub. “Jennie may have to
sleep on the sidewalk to-night. Well, we’ve done
what we could.”</p>

<p>“And then maybe she won’t come at all,” said
Harry, hopefully.</p>

<p>“What good will that do?” Chub asked.</p>

<p>“Why, then we can keep store again to-morrow.
Wouldn’t you just love to?”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Chub, doubtfully.</p>

<small>A MIDNIGHT ALARM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When they reached camp and the <i>Slow Poke</i>,
Dick and Roy were busy about the fire,
while Dr. Emery, in a pair of old gray knicker-bockers
and a blue flannel shirt, was cleaning fish
on a stone at the edge of the water.</p>

<p>“Look here at this one, Chub!” called the doctor,
proudly, as he held one of his trophies up by
its tail.</p>

<p>Chub examined it with interest and had to acknowledge
that it was pretty nearly as big as
his own famous fish.</p>

<p>“You didn’t get so very many, though, did
you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the doctor, “we didn’t. I
don’t believe it’s a very good stream any longer.
About fished out, I think. There’s a large summer
boarding-house up there, about a mile in, and
then we came across a good-sized camp of Gypsies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
They’re fond of fishing and pretty skilful,
too. But Roy says the map shows another
stream to the north that we might try. That is,
if we cared to stay here another day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think we’d better stay a day or two
longer,” Chub replied. “It’s such a dandy
camping-site, doctor, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>The doctor decapitated a trout deftly and replied
with enthusiasm that he did. Chub smiled
as he watched him and remembered when even to
have stood in such close proximity with the doctor
would have filled him with vast uneasiness.
The doctor had been a good deal in the sun to-day,
and the end of his nose was scarlet, while other
little patches of the same shade were spread above
his eyes and on his cheeks.</p>

<p>“You’ll be needing some cold cream to-night,
sir,” Chub said. “You’re burned.”</p>

<p>The doctor felt of his nose gingerly. “It—it’s
quite tender to the touch,” he said wonderingly.
“I had no idea the sun was so hot. There, that’s
the last one. All ready, Dick. Will you bring
the pan over here, or shall I—”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it, sir,” said Chub.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later they were seated around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the table—just a yard-square piece of white oil-cloth
spread over the grass between the river
bank and the tent. It wasn’t the most even table
in the world, and Dick unfortunately set the
coffee-pot down on a place where it managed to
topple over when no one was watching it. That
necessitated a new brew. But they were all hungry
and happy, as one generally is out of doors
under the trees and the sky, and the fiasco was
only a matter for laughter.</p>

<p>“See that hump, Dick?” asked Chub, gravely.</p>

<p>There was much to talk about. Dr. Emery and
Roy and Dick had their fishing adventures to narrate,
and Harry and Chub must tell about Mrs.
Peel and the store, and Bennie, and Mrs. Benson
and her awe-inspiring husband. Dick was especially
eloquent on the subject of the Gypsies whose
camp they had passed in returning from the fishing-site.</p>

<p>“There were dozens of them, Chub, and they
had the dandiest wagons you ever saw. Painted
up like circus wagons, they were. And there
were about ten horses there. We saw the queen,
too, Harry. She was sitting in the door of her
tent, the biggest one of all, it was, and braiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
sweet-grass; making baskets, I guess; there were
a lot of them hanging around camp.”</p>

<p>“I thought the queens never did any work,”
Chub objected.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I never saw but one band of
Gypsies before; we don’t have ’em out West
much.”</p>

<p>“There was one young fellow,” said Roy, “that
wasn’t any darker than I am. Dick insists that
he is a white person and was stolen when a child.”</p>

<p>“Well, he might have been,” said Dick. “You
read about such things.”</p>

<p>“In books,” added Chub—“books like ‘Little
Goldie’s Vow,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>Chub darted a glance at Harry’s disturbed
countenance and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nothing that you should know about, Roy.
It’s a novel. When you’re a few years older—”</p>

<p>But Roy threatened him with the contents of his
tin cup, and Chub ceased. After supper was over
and the things cleaned up they went back to the
boat and climbed to the upper deck. The breeze,
which had mitigated the heat during the day, had
died down, and it was cooler here than on shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
It was dark by the time they settled down, and
Dick brought up a half-dozen Japanese lanterns
and strung them along the awning rods. When
the candles were lighted they threw quite a radiance
over the scene.</p>

<p>“It’s just like a party,” said Harry. “Let’s
play games!”</p>

<p>“Anything but ‘going to Jerusalem,’” said
Chub, drowsily, from where he was stretched out
in his chair. “I don’t feel that I am able to walk
that far to-night.”</p>

<p>“We’ll play ‘fish, flesh, or fowl,’” said Harry,
“and I’m ‘it.’”</p>

<p>“You always are ‘it,’” said Chub gallantly.</p>

<p>“Papa, you draw your chair over that way
more,” said Harry, ignoring Chub’s compliment.
“We must sit in a circle. Come, Chub.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” Chub murmured. “It sounds a bit
difficult, though, sitting in a circle. How’s this,
Harry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Chub, don’t be so silly,” Harry laughed.
“Put your feet down and behave. Now I’ll begin.
The first one that doesn’t answer correctly
must take my place.” The deck was soon ringing
with laughter, for, of course, some funny things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
happened. As when Harry, suddenly poising in
front of Chub, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Fowl! One, two, three—”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” exclaimed Chub, with a jump.</p>

<p>“Four, five, six—”</p>

<p>“Er—er—”</p>

<p>“Seven, eight, nine—”</p>

<p>“Bullfrog!”</p>

<p>“You’re ‘it’!” cried Harry. “A bullfrog
isn’t a fowl.”</p>

<p>Chub strove to temporize.</p>

<p>“Did you say fowl? Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Chub, she caught you,” said Roy
“Be game!”</p>

<p>“That isn’t fair,” grumbled Chub. “Of course
a bullfrog isn’t exactly a fowl, but everybody
knows that frog legs taste just exactly like
chicken, and so—”</p>

<p>“Get up, get up, you lazy duffer!” cried Dick.</p>

<p>Chub got up and fixed Dick with a malevolent
scowl. Then he walked over to him and remarked
conversationally:</p>

<p>“Fish! One, two, three, four, seven, ten!”</p>

<p>“Here! You didn’t count right!” objected
Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, now!” said Chub, contemptuously.
“That’s right, try to get out of it!”</p>

<p>But Dick got up and immediately caught the
doctor, who gazed blankly at him while he counted
the fateful ten. Harry clapped her hands delightedly.</p>

<p>“Papa’s ‘it’!” she cried. “Now we’ll have
some fun!”</p>

<p>The doctor got up and surveyed the four laughing
faces anxiously.</p>

<p>“Let me see, now; what is it I say?” They explained
it to him, and he made for Harry.</p>

<p>“I’m a fish!” he cried. “One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
thirteen, fourteen—”</p>

<p>He might have been counting yet had not they
stopped him, for Harry had gone off into a gale
of laughter and was quite incapable of words.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t say ‘I’m a fish,’” she explained
finally. “You just say ‘fish.’ And you must
only count to ten, papa.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Then I’ll try again,” answered the doctor,
cheerfully. He fixed Harry with a stern look
and said:</p>

<p>“Fish! One, two—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Flounder!” cried Harry.</p>

<p>“Three, four, five, six—”</p>

<p>“But I said it!” Harry cried. “You mustn’t
count any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then what must I do now?”</p>

<p>“You must try again until you catch some one.
Try Dick.”</p>

<p>So the doctor tried Dick with no better result,
and then Roy and finally Chub.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t say ‘fish’ every time,” Harry
explained. “If you do, we know what to expect.
Try ‘fowl’ or ‘flesh.’” But the doctor shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better stick to fish,” he replied.
“I can remember that. Besides, I’m fond of
fish.”</p>

<p>Finally Chub took pity on him and allowed
himself to be caught, and the doctor sank gratefully
into his chair, sighing with relief and mopping
his face with his handkerchief. They tried
other games after that and kept up the fun until
the clock in the wheel-house warned them that it
was past bedtime. The doctor and Harry slept
on the boat, but the boys sought the tent on shore.
The moon came up while they were getting ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
for bed, and with it came a fresh breeze out of the
southwest, which, according to Chub, “just filled
the bill.” At all events, it made the tent a much
more comfortable sleeping-place, and it wasn’t
very long before they were all slumbering.</p>

<p>If Chub was first asleep, he was likewise the
first of the three to awake. He sat bolt upright,
staring through the gray door of the tent. The
sky had clouded over, and the moonlight no longer
made the night radiant. Chub wondered what had
awakened him, and even as he wondered the answer
came to him in a shrill, frightened cry from
the house-boat:</p>

<p>“<em>Papa! Chub! Help!</em>”</p>

<p>It was Harry’s voice, and Chub was out of the
tent in an instant, with a whoop of reassurance.
The world was gray-black, and objects were only
dimly discernible. But he knew the way to the
boat well enough, and went hurrying, stumbling
over the grass and through the little bushes. As
he went, a light sprang into view somewhere
aboard, Snip barked loudly, and at the same moment
he collided with a figure on the bank.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” called Chub. “What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">
<a id="i_p291">
  <img src="images/i_p291.jpg" width="403" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_292">The figure disappeared noiselessly into the night</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292-<br />293]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no response, and <a href="#i_p291">the figure disappeared
noiselessly into the night</a>. Then a white-clad
figure appeared at the edge of the boat, and
the doctor’s voice said:</p>

<p>“Dick! Chub! Are you there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Chub, scrambling aboard.
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Harry had a fright,” replied the doctor,
calmly. “I fancy she was only dreaming, but
she says she awoke and saw some one at her window
on the other side of the boat. But I heard
no one until you came.”</p>

<p>“I did,” answered Chub, looking regretfully
back. “I ran into some one just before you
called. I asked who it was, and got no answer.”</p>

<p>By that time Dick and Roy, who had hastily
put on some clothes, though still half asleep, had
joined them, questioning excitedly.</p>

<p>“Let’s get something on and have a look
around,” suggested Roy when the doctor had told
his story again. So they hurried back to the tent
and drew on coats and trousers, while the doctor
returned to Harry again.</p>

<p>When they returned to the boat, Harry had
joined the doctor in the forward cabin. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
slipped on a blue kimono and was seated on the
window-seat, with her feet tucked under her,
still rather pale of face, but trying to smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what waked me up,” she said.
“But suddenly I was sitting up in bed and looking
at the little window. At first I didn’t see anything,
and then a man’s head and shoulders appeared.
I could see him against the gray sky;
just for a minute, for I let out an awful screech,
and the man disappeared just like that!” And
Harry snapped her small fingers. “Papa says I
dreamed it, but I didn’t, really; I was wide
awake!”</p>

<p>The doctor shot a warning glance at the boys,
and Chub, who had opened his mouth, shut it
again quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, dreams seem very real sometimes,”
said the doctor, soothingly. “And even if there
was any one there, I guess he was just looking
around. I don’t believe he stole anything.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” said Chub, as he moved
toward the door. “Anyhow, don’t you worry
about it now, Harry. He’s gone by this time. I
shouldn’t be surprised if he was as scared as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
were when you screamed! Whew! it brought me
up in bed like a shock of electricity!”</p>

<p>Harry laughed nervously.</p>

<p>“I—I think I’ll sleep in here with you, papa,”
she said. The doctor smiled and looked at his
watch.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we won’t have to do much more
sleeping,” said the doctor. “It’s after four
o’clock. You lie down, Harry, and try to go to
sleep again. The boys and I will look around a
little and see if we can see any hoof-marks from
your nightmare.”</p>

<p>“You won’t go far?” asked Harry, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, no, I won’t leave the boat,” he answered.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry I woke everybody up,”
said Harry, apologetically. “I suppose it was
terribly silly of me, but I was so—so startled—”</p>

<p>“Shucks,” said Roy, “we don’t mind. It’s
rather a lark.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Chub, “it’s what is known as rising
with the lark.”</p>

<p>Harry laughed quite naturally at that, and they
left her to go over the boat and see if the early
morning marauder had taken anything off with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
him. They found signs of his presence as soon
as they reached the after cabin, for burnt matches
were scattered about the floor, and three cans of
peaches had been moved from the galley to Dick’s
bed.</p>

<p>“Evidently meant to take these with him and
got scared off,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Maybe he meant to take bed and all,” Chub
suggested. “Let’s look in the engine-room and
see if he’s left the engine.”</p>

<p>They poked around for a while longer with
their lanterns, but found no further evidences.
By that time the sky was brightening in the east,
and Roy suggested that, instead of going back to
bed, they have an early breakfast and go fishing
before it got hot. Even the doctor agreed enthusiastically
to the proposition, and, still discussing
and conjecturing, they returned to the
tent. They had breakfast at a quarter to six.
Harry was not on hand. She had fallen asleep
again, and they didn’t disturb her. Roy volunteered
to stay behind and keep her company, and
at half-past six the others set out merrily to try
the new stream. Roy cleaned up the breakfast
things, keeping Harry’s repast warm at the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of the fire. Then adding fresh fuel, he climbed to
the upper deck of the boat and made himself comfortable
with a magazine. Harry appeared at
half-past seven, looking none the worse for her
interrupted slumbers.</p>

<p>“Well, any more nightmares?” asked Roy,
cheerfully. Harry shook her head smilingly.</p>

<p>“No, but I don’t think it was a nightmare,
Roy,” she answered. She seemed, however, less
certain about it than before. Perhaps she wanted
to believe in the dream theory as much as any one.
Roy served breakfast to her and stood by attentively
with a dish-towel over his arm, suggesting
respectfully, <a href="#i_p299">“A little more of the hegg, ma’am?”</a>
or “Another cup of coffee, ma’am?” Then, when
Harry had finished, they washed the rest of the
dishes very merrily and tidied up the camp and
the boat. Harry wanted very much to walk over
to the store and find out whether Jennie had arrived,
but, as it had been agreed that the boat was
not to be left unguarded, Roy couldn’t accompany
her, and she preferred not to go alone. Roy was
all for returning to his chair on deck and his magazine,
but Harry wouldn’t allow it. The flower-boxes,
she declared, were greatly in need of water;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and so Roy worked hard for a time with a pail and
a dipper, Harry superintending his labors. When
the last dipperful had been distributed, Roy set
down the pail with a sigh of relief and looked
ingratiatingly at Harry. But the spirit of unrest
still possessed that young lady, and after a moment
of thought her brow cleared, and she cried:</p>

<p>“Now we’ll make some doughnuts!”</p>

<p>“Will we?” asked Roy, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Yes; Chub and I got everything yesterday.
It’ll be lots of fun, and the others will be so surprised
when they come home and find doughnuts
for dinner. Chub is so fond of them!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that’s what makes it seem kind of
mean of me to help,” said Roy, earnestly. “He’d
love to be here, you know. Suppose we wait until
he can help?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t mind,” answered Harry lightly.
“He’d much rather eat them than make them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_297">“A little more of the hegg, ma’am?”</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300-<br />301]</a></span></p>

<p>“So would I,” thought Roy. But he didn’t
say so. Instead, he followed Harry down to the
galley with a sigh which this time didn’t suggest
relief. For the next two hours there were great
doings. Harry, with numerous towels pinned
about her in lieu of an apron, and Roy, with his
coat off and his sleeves tucked above his elbows,
measured and mixed and beat; at least, Harry
did; Roy stood by and did what he was told, but
the tasks which fell to him were menial in the
extreme. In spite of the limitations of space and
utensils, the frying was a big success, and, as Roy
was allowed to help himself to the sizzling, hot
doughnuts as soon as they were sugared, he regained
some degree of happiness.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Harry, when the last batch
was being powdered with sugar from an improvised
shaker which Roy had fashioned from
a baking-powder tin by punching holes in the lid.
“That makes eight dozen and three. And then
you ate—how many, Roy?”</p>

<p>“Five,” answered Roy, promptly and unblushingly.</p>

<p>“Roy Porter! You won’t have any appetite for
dinner!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” Roy laughed. “As long as
you’re around I guess I’ll manage to work up an
appetite. I suppose we’d better dust the river
next or trim the trees.”</p>

<p>“You’re just too lazy for anything,” laughed
Harry. “For goodness’ sake go and sit down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not for worlds!” he said indignantly. “I
can’t bear to be idle. I shall fish from the tender.
Want to come along?”</p>

<p>Harry did, so they scrambled into the little boat
with a few worms and a couple of lines, and
rowed a little way into the stream.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t go very far away,” said Harry,
“in case—”</p>

<p>“Your nightmare came back,” teased Roy.</p>

<p>“Do you think it was that?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” he answered evasively.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe. But it didn’t seem
like a dream.”</p>

<p>“Lots of dreams don’t. Hand me the bait-can,
please.”</p>

<p>They fished for nearly an hour without having
even a nibble, and then rowed disgustedly back
to the boat. Shortly before noon the rest of the
party returned almost empty-handed. The doctor
had landed three small trout, Chub two, and
Dick none.</p>

<p>“The stream’s too small,” said the doctor.
“To-morrow—” he hesitated—“if we’re still
here, we’ll try the first stream and go higher up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you see our friends the Gypsies?” asked
Roy.</p>

<p>“All over the shop,” answered Chub. “We
met two fishing and passed a couple more about
ten minutes ago. They had two gunny-sacks on
their backs, and I’ll bet they’d been stealing
things. Get busy with dinner, Dick; I’m almost
dead, I’m so hungry. This early breakfast business
won’t do.”</p>

<p>When the meal was ready, Chub let out a howl
of delight.</p>

<p>“Doughnuts!” he shouted. “Hooray! Where’d
you get ’em?”</p>

<p>“Made them, of course,” replied Roy, loftily.
“Harry assisted me. She’s real handy about the
kitchen. I don’t know what I’d have done without
her.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Chub. “She could have done
without you, Roy. You ate more than she made.”</p>

<p>“Roy did beautifully,” Harry said. “I
couldn’t have got along without him.”</p>

<p>Roy bowed impressively, and Chub grunted in
derision. But the latter had to acknowledge that
the doughnuts couldn’t have been better even
without Roy’s interference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Dinner over, Harry declared that they must
go to the store and make certain that Jennie had
arrived.</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” said Dick. “I want to see
your old store.”</p>

<p>The doctor elected to stay at home and do some
work, and they left him on the upper deck, immersed
in his books, with a fountain pen clasped
tightly between his teeth, and his pad of paper on
his knee.</p>

<p>“I think,” laughed Roy, “that any one could
come along and steal everything out of the boat
without the doctor knowing anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Sure they could,” Chub agreed. “But no one
will come around when they see him there.”</p>

<p>When they came in sight of the store, Harry
gave out a cry of distress.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody there!” she exclaimed.
“It’s all closed up! She never came.”</p>

<p>“Well,” murmured Chub, sorrowfully, “I
never did have much faith in Jennie.”</p>

<p>“I guess we might as well go back, then,” said
Dick.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort!” returned Harry, determinedly.
“We’ll get the key and open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
store. Mrs. Peel left us in charge, and it’s our
duty to do it. Why, just think of all the money
we may have missed already to-day! It’s a perfect
shame, Chub.”</p>

<p>“I know; thousands of dollars, likely.” Chub
shook his head gloomily. “Maybe we’ll have to
go into bankruptcy. You run over and get the
key, Harry.” But Harry shook her head in distress.</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t, Chub. I never could make
her hear me. You go.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Chub, “I’ll do my best, but
my voice isn’t very strong to-day.” He crossed
the road toward the little cottage.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Chub mounted the porch and tapped with the
iron knocker, while the rest waited and
watched on the other side of the empty street.
After a while he tapped again, and after a longer
while the door opened and the same old lady
peered out, her spectacles astride the tip of her
nose. Harry and Roy and Dick heard the conversation
begin, saw the old lady lean forward
and place a hand behind one ear, and saw Chub
nerve himself for a new effort. After that they
heard every word beautifully.</p>

<p>“I called for the key of the store,” said Chub,
loudly.</p>

<p>“Nothing to-day,” replied the old lady, starting
to close the door. Chub deftly introduced one
knee between the door and the frame.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand! <a href="#i_p309">I want the key of the store!”</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
He pointed across the street. “Mrs.
Peel’s store!”</p>

<p>The old lady shaded her eyes and peered across
at the waiting group.</p>

<p>“Feels sore, does he? Which one is it?
How’d he do it?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t! I mean—Look here, ma’am, I
want the key we left here last night! The key!
<em>Key!</em>”</p>

<p>“Key?” asked the old lady mildly.</p>

<p>“Yes’m.” They could almost hear Chub’s
sigh of relief. “We’re going to open the store.
Mrs. Peel’s niece didn’t come.”</p>

<p>“You want the key?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, please.”</p>

<p>“Are you the gentleman who left it here?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“What say?”</p>

<p>“<em>Yes, ma’am!</em>”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t yell so. I’m a little deaf, but I
don’t have to be yelled at, young man.”</p>

<p>“No’m.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What say?”</p>

<p>“<em>It’s a nice day!</em>” bawled Chub, desperately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I’m a-going for it. Ain’t any sense
being so impatient. Sit down and wait a minute.
I don’t remember just where I put it.”</p>

<p>Chub retired to the railing and wiped his brow,
while the old lady carefully closed and locked the
door. Across the street the others were struggling
with their laughter.</p>

<p>“Did you make her hear?” asked Dick, softly.
Chub made a gesture of despair and felt of his
throat gingerly. Presently the door opened
again and the old lady held out the key.</p>

<p>“When’s she coming back?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Chub. “I haven’t
heard.”</p>

<p>“Third? Not till then? You going to keep
store for her?”</p>

<p>“Just for to-day, I guess,” answered Chub,
wearily.</p>

<p>“Eh? I can’t hear you. You don’t talk plain.
She ain’t sold out, has she?”</p>

<p>“<em>No, ma’am, she hasn’t!</em>” shouted Chub.
Then he plunged across the porch and made his
escape. The old lady remained at her front door,
watching and muttering, long after they had
opened the store and disappeared inside.</p>

<p>“Here’s a couple of letters,” said Dick, as
Chub raised the window-curtains. They were
lying on the floor just over the threshold, and he
picked them up and examined them. “One for
Miss Jennie Frost and one for Mrs. Amanda
Peel. Strange I didn’t get anything.”</p>

<p>He handed them to Harry, and she looked them
over critically.</p>

<p>“This one’s from Mrs. Peel to her niece,” she
said. “And the other—Chub, where did you say
Jennie lived?”</p>

<p>“Byers, or something like that. Why?”</p>

<p>“Because this other letter is postmarked Byers.
It just means, I suppose, that Jennie can’t come.”</p>

<p>“Probably.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could open the other letter, the one
from Mrs. Peel, and see when she’s coming back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but of course we can’t,” said Roy. “Besides,
what does it matter?”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems too bad to have the store shut
up, doesn’t it? I’m sure Mrs. Peel needs money
badly. I’ll put these letters in the cash drawer.”</p>

<p>“Come and look at the pocket-knives, Roy,”
called Dick. “I’m going to have one. There’s
a <em>dandy</em> here for seventy-five cents. Look.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, do buy one, Dick,” called Harry. “We
ought all to buy something and help her out.
I’ve got fifty cents, and I’m going to see what
I want.”</p>

<p>Eventually Harry proudly added the following
items to her record of sales:</p>

<p>Harry frowned and figured for a while and then
announced exultantly that they had already sold
two dollars and thirty-three cents’ worth of goods.
“Isn’t that fine?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The old lady hasn’t sold that much before in
a week,” said Chub. “Who wants some crackers
and cheese? Or some raisins? The cheese is
fine, but the crackers are a little bit stale.”</p>

<p>They perched themselves on the counter and
partook of Chub’s hospitality, Dick suggested
craftily that if they all ate as much as they could
now it wouldn’t be necessary to prepare so much
supper when they went back to camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“And there’s something in that, too,” Dick
continued, “for our stores are getting pretty low.
We’ll have to have some fresh meat about to-morrow,
and some eggs, and—let me see; what
else was it I thought of? I know; kerosene. And
the ice-chest has been empty for nearly a week.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t need ice,” said Chub.</p>

<p>“We do in this sort of weather if we’re going
to keep meat fresh. And I’d like mighty well
to see a little fresh milk and not have to use that
canned stuff. And we’re about out of that, too.”</p>

<p>“We can get condensed milk here,” said Roy.
“I saw some over there on the shelf.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s!” said Harry.</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” Chub said. “To-night
we’ll look over the boat and make a list of what
we need. Then if we can get any of the things
here we’ll do it. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Good scheme,” replied Roy. “It’ll put some
money in Mrs. Peel’s pocket.”</p>

<p>They were still discussing it when there was the
sound of a wagon stopping in front of the store.
The arrivals proved to be a farmer and his wife,
and for the next quarter of an hour all hands were
busy. The farmer wanted axle-grease, horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
liniment, five-pounds of red ocher, five gallons of
kerosene, a bag of flour, and ten pounds of
sugar. While the boys were hunting these things
up, Harry was following the farmer’s wife all
around the store, from one show-case to another,
explaining the absence of Mrs. Peel and exhibiting
the goods.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I call it right down kind of you
young folks to keep store for her,” declared the
woman. “I hope her sister ain’t very sick, but
she didn’t look real strong when she was here
awhile back. How much is that wide yellow
ribbon?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen cents a yard,” replied Harry
promptly, having thoroughly investigated the
contents of the ribbon-case and the prices earlier
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“My, ain’t that a lot? Still, I always was
partial to yellow; it seems so sort of cheerful,
don’t it? You can cut me a yard and a quarter,
I guess. And I want a dozen sheets of writing-paper,
the kind that’s ruled, you know, and a
package of envelopes to fit.”</p>

<p>When the customers departed, Harry reckoned
up the sales and announced gleefully that four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
dollars and twelve cents had been added to the
treasury.</p>

<p>“I haven’t had so much fun since I had the
measles,” said Chub. “Did you observe the
artistic way in which I did up that bundle?”</p>

<p>“And did you see me handle the sugar-scoop?”
asked Dick. “I believe I was cut out for a storekeeper,
fellows.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to order some more kerosene
soon,” remarked Roy. “I pumped the tank almost
dry filling the old farmer’s can for him.
Where do we buy our kerosene?”</p>

<p>“Standard Oil Company,” answered Chub,
promptly. “I’ll drop a note to Mr. Rockefeller
this evening. I wonder what she keeps gasolene
for?”</p>

<p>“Maybe for automobiles,” suggested Harry.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe an automobile ever stopped in
this village,” Chub replied.</p>

<p>“Plenty of them go by, though,” Dick said.
“I’ve seen four this afternoon. I think this is
the main road along here, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What we ought to do,” announced Chub, “is
to let them know that we keep it. We ought
to put a sign out. Wait a minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>He went out into the back yard and rummaged
around until he found a board some four feet
long by ten inches wide. He brought it in and
pulled a marking-pot and brush from under the
counter.</p>

<p>“Now then,” he said as he dipped the brush
and began to print, “here goes for the automobile
trade!” Five minutes later the sign was done
and they were nailing it to the corner of the
store, where it was visible for a hundred yards
up the road. Chub had lettered it as follows:</p>

<p class="noic">HEADQUARTERS FOR AUTOMOBILISTS<br />
GASOLENE AND SUPPLIES</p>

<p>But Chub wasn’t yet satisfied. On the back
of a piece of cardboard he printed “Midsummer
Sale!” This he placed in one of the windows,
saying, “I’m pretty certain that Mrs. Peel is
asking a heap less than her husband did. You
see, there’s a store some place near here that’s
getting her trade away from her, and it’s safe
to say she’s marked things pretty low.”</p>

<p>“How about your automobile supplies?” asked
Roy. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say ‘automobile supplies,’” answered
Chub. “I said ‘gasolene and supplies’.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
We’ve got all sorts of supplies, haven’t we?
‘Supplies’ means crackers and cheese and such
things just as much as it does carburetors,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but it sounds sort of misleading.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you come right down to it, we’ve got
plenty of things automobilists use. We’ve got
grease and wrenches and files and pliers—and
water—”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Dick. “We don’t
claim to have a full line of supplies. We’re
short on goggles, pink veils, spark-plugs, and
extra tires.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be lovely,” asked Harry, “if a
big automobile should stop and buy a whole lot of
things?”</p>

<p>“Yes, say about fifty gallons of gasolene, a
dozen files, half a dozen wrenches, and a pail of
water!” laughed Chub.</p>

<p>“Well, they might buy something,” replied
Harry, cheerfully. “And if any one should ask
for a pink veil I’d show them the mosquito
netting.”</p>

<p>“Harry, you’ve missed your vocation,” Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
laughed. “You should have been a shopkeeper.
Hello, what’s that?”</p>

<p>There was a loud grinding of brakes outside,
and a big red touring-car which had coasted
noiselessly down the hill came to a sudden stop
at the corner almost under the new sign. Before
they could reach the door a man in a yellow duster,
evidently a chauffeur, hurried in.</p>

<p>“I want some gasolene,” he announced brusquely.
“Where do you keep it?”</p>

<p>“In the back yard,” replied Chub, promptly.
“Come on. How much do you want?”</p>

<p>“Five gallons will do. Is it any good?”</p>

<p>“Best made,” answered Chub. “We get it
direct. Come on.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur followed him with a growl.</p>

<p>“Bet it’s low-test stuff,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Roy went out with them, while Harry and Dick
sauntered out on the sidewalk, where they could
see the car and its occupants. There were two
ladies and a gentleman in the back of the car,
and a second gentleman was seated in front.
They all wore dust-coats, and from the appearance
of the car it was evident that they were
touring. One of the ladies glanced around and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
caught sight of Harry and said something to the
gentleman beside her. He, too, turned, and in a
moment they were all looking. Harry colored
and drew back around the corner. Dick, however,
held his ground.</p>

<p>“Got anything to eat in there?” asked the man
in front.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dick answered. “Crackers, cheese,
canned things, raisins, dried apricots—”</p>

<p>There was a burst of laughter from the car.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out and see what we can find,” said
one of the ladies. In a moment the store was
invaded. They bought crackers, cheese, canned
peaches, potted ham, and sardines, and did it so
merrily that Harry and Dick had to laugh with
them. The party bore their purchases back to
the car, Dick assisting, and immediately began
their luncheon or, as one of the ladies laughingly
called it, “afternoon tea.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t paid for it” she said suddenly.
“How much do we owe you?”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Dick, “there was a pound
of crackers—”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said one of the men, taking a
bill from his purse. “Here’s five dollars. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
guess that will pay for the gasolene and everything.
You keep the rest.”</p>

<p>“It won’t come to anything like that,” Dick
protested. “The crackers are—”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to hear how much they are,”
laughed the second lady. “They might not taste
so well, and when you haven’t had a mouthful to
eat since eleven o’clock—”</p>

<p>“Never mind about counting it up,” said the
man to Dick, genially. “That five dollar bill will
cover it all.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Dick, gravely.</p>

<p>The chauffeur appeared with the gasolene
poured it into the tank, and tossed the can to
Dick.</p>

<p>“Poorest stuff I ever saw,” he muttered
savagely as he climbed to his seat. “All right,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” replied the gentleman beside him.
The car sprang forward and in a moment had
disappeared in a cloud of dust. Dick went back
to the store.</p>

<p>“Did they pay you?” asked Harry, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I should say they did.” Dick exhibited the
five-dollar bill. “He said this would pay for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
gasolene and the other stuff, and I was to keep
the change. I kept it.”</p>

<p>“But the chauffeur paid for the gasolene!”
cried Roy. “Call them back!”</p>

<p>“You go out and call,” said Dick, dryly.
“They’re a mile away by this time. If they
want their money, they’ll come back for it.
Meanwhile it goes to Mrs. Peel.” He deposited
the five-dollar note in the till. Harry clapped
her hands ecstatically.</p>

<p>“Six dollars more!” she cried. “You must all
help me put it down. How much were the sardines,
Dick?”</p>

<p>Half an hour later a small boy appeared and
bought a bottle of peppermint and two sticks of
candy, and that completed the day’s sales. At six
o’clock they closed the store. Chub locked the
door into the living-rooms and put the key on a
nearby shelf.</p>

<p>“There’s no use having that open,” he said,
“since Jennie isn’t coming.”</p>

<p>On the sidewalk they paused irresolutely.</p>

<p>“You take it over to her,” said Chub to Dick,
holding forth the key. But Dick shrank away
from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not me!” he cried. “I never could make her
hear!”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Roy, “why not keep the
key ourselves? It isn’t likely that Mrs. Peel will
be back before to-morrow. We can come over
early in the morning and open up again.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Harry agreed. “And we’ll leave
a note on the door in case she should come.”</p>

<p>So the note was written and pinned up, and
they started back to the boat.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” asked Harry, uneasily, when
they were climbing the hill, “that it’s quite safe
to leave all that money in the store over night?
There’s over twenty dollars.”</p>

<p>Chub waved the key under her nose.</p>

<p>“But some one might break in,” she insisted.</p>

<p>“Shucks! Don’t you worry, Harry; I’ll
wager there hasn’t been a robbery around here
since the place was started.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know, Chub. Does he?” she appealed
to the others. “If that money should be
stolen, you’ll have to make it good.”</p>

<p>“Me?” asked Chub. “Certainly. I’ll make it
good. That’s one of the easy things I do. I
hereby place myself under a thirteen-dollar bond.”</p>

<p class="cap">“Kerosene, potatoes, condensed milk, cheese,
and bacon,” said Dick, writing the items on
a slip of paper.</p>

<p>Chub groaned.</p>

<p>“More bacon?” he asked dismally.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to have some sort of meat,”
answered Dick, “and we can’t get fresh meat
here. All those things we can get at the store
to-morrow. But we’ll have to reach a real town
pretty soon. We ought to have meat and fresh
vegetables and fruit.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Roy, “there are plenty of
farms around here. Why not see if we can’t get
some vegetables and fruit at one of them to-morrow?
And some milk too?”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” said Chub. “I delegate you and
Dick to buy those things.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Dick. “There’s a farm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
a big old farm a little way beyond the village; you
can see it from the road. And seems to me it’s
almost time for corn, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Roy. “And don’t we need more
eggs?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dick. “I forgot eggs. And,
I say, maybe they will sell us a couple of nice
young chickens. We’ll start right after breakfast.
Want to come along, Harry?”</p>

<p>But Harry shook her head. “Chub and I have
to look after the store,” she replied importantly.</p>

<p>“That’s so, I’d forgotten the store. Well, you
take this list along, Chub, and bring those things
back with you at noon. I’ll put down the quantities
we need. Who’s got any money?”</p>

<p>“Money!” exclaimed Chub. “Where’s that
large sum we intrusted to you a week ago?”</p>

<p>“Large sum!” responded Dick indignantly.
“It was two dollars! How long do you think two
dollars is going to last? I’m down to my last
cent, and I don’t suppose I can get a check cashed
around here.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely,” said Chub. “I’ve some money,
though. Here’s two dollars to spend on vegetables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and I’ll pay for what we get at the store.
Are you keeping the account straight, Roy?”</p>

<p>“I guess so, I put down whatever any one tells
me to. It’s hot down here. Let’s get back on
deck.”</p>

<p>The doctor was sitting in one of the willow
chairs, his gaze on the opposite shore of the river,
where a few faint lights twinkled through the
darkness. Chub lighted the lamp in the wheel-house,
and Harry stopped behind her father and
rumpled his hair playfully.</p>

<p>“Asleep, papa?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Asleep? By no means, my dear. The fact
is, I was—” he paused and laughed amusedly—“I
was occupied in rather a funny way. I was
making up a riddle.”</p>

<p>“A riddle!” said Harry. “That’s nice. What
is it, papa?”</p>

<p>“Well, see if you can guess it, any of you.”</p>

<p>“That means me,” said Chub, perching himself
on the rail and hugging a stanchion. “If
there’s one thing I pride myself on, it’s elucidating
riddles. Elucidator’s my middle name.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell me what it is that</p>

</div></div>

<p>“Why, it’s poetry!” declared Harry.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t claim much for the rhymes,”
answered the doctor, modestly. “Got it, Chub?”</p>

<p>“Er—well, you see, sir, being in rhyme makes
it more difficult.”</p>

<p>The others jeered.</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t mean that I can’t guess it,
only that it requires more effort. Now let me see:
‘Flies through the air without wings;’ that’s a
balloon. ‘Swims through the sea without fins;’

</div></div>

<p class="noi">replied the doctor.</p>

<p>Chub was silent a moment. Then, “I—I think
it’s an ichthyosaurus,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to guess again,” laughed the
doctor. “How about you, Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>“I give it up,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Roy and Harry in unison.</p>

<p>“And you, Chub?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course I could get it in time, but as
the others are impatient, I won’t stand in their
way, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very kind of you, sir,” said the doctor. “It’s
a ship.”</p>

<p>Every one said “Oh!”—every one save Chub.</p>

<p>“I should have guessed that next,” he remarked
easily.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a fib, Chub!” said Harry. “You’d
never have guessed it, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see what you mean about ‘nails
and no toes,’” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Don’t you? Why, a ship’s put together with
nails, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” murmured Dick, while the rest laughed.
“And—and how about the rest of it, sir?”</p>

<p>“A sheet is a rope that hoists a sail, as you
doubtless know,” explained the doctor. “As for
the fingers and rings, why, the masts are the fingers,
and the rings are the wooden rings that the
sails are attached to. There you are, sir.”</p>

<p>“To think of you making that up yourself!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
sighed Harry. “You did make it up yourself,
papa?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s quite home-made,” was the reply.
“Suppose the rest of you try it.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t make mine rhyme,” said Harry.
“I never could make things rhyme.”</p>

<p>“I will make up the first one,” said Chub.
“Are you all ready?” They told him they were,
and Chub cleared his throat portentously.</p>

<p>“Well—er—why am I like a young pig with a
pink nose?”</p>

<p>“There’s so many reasons,” said Dick, “but, to
keep you in good humor, I speak for all when I
say we give it up.”</p>

<p>“Because I’m always Eaton: see? <em>Eaton—eating!</em>”</p>

<p>“What’s the pink nose got to do with it?”
asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just put that in to make it harder.”</p>

<p>“That’s a rank conundrum!” jeered Dick.</p>

<p>“There speaks envy,” returned Chub, sadly.
“Let’s hear you give a better one.”</p>

<p>“All right. Why did the animals go into the
ark?”</p>

<p>“Because there was Noah else!” shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Harry. “That’s an old one, Dick, and you
didn’t make it up at all.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t say I did. Chub challenged me to
give a better one, and I did it.”</p>

<p>“Here’s one,” said Roy. “I think it’s original,
but I won’t vouch for it. When is a wagon
not a wagon?”</p>

<p>“When it’s a cart?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“When it’s awheel,” cried Harry, eagerly.</p>

<p>“N-no, but that isn’t so bad. Give it up?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When it turns into a road.”</p>

<p>“That’s lovely!” said Harry. “I must remember
that. ‘When is a wagon not a wagon?
When it’s a road;’ no, no, ‘when it turns <em>into</em> a
road.’ I know one, but it’s not original.”</p>

<p>“Out with it,” said Chub. “The answer’s on
the tip of my tongue.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what’s the best age for a small
house?”</p>

<p>“Cott-age,” answered Dick, to Harry’s disappointment.</p>

<p>“You knew it,” she objected. “You ought to
have let Chub try.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pshaw! he’d never have guessed it. He
hasn’t guessed one yet.”</p>

<p>“Just wanted to give the rest of you a show,”
replied Chub, amiably. “Don’t you know any
more, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said the doctor. “I used to
know some. Here’s one; perhaps you all know
it, however.”</p>

<p>“Do I know it, papa?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“If you do you mustn’t tell. Now then: What
throat trouble did George Washington have when
he chopped down the cherry-tree?”</p>

<p>Nobody knew, and the doctor had to dispel their
ignorance.</p>

<p>“Why, a hacking cough, to be sure. And what
remedy did his father give him?”</p>

<p>“A licking,” said Chub. “Hand me the prize,
please.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; this was a remedy for throat trouble.
He gave him cherry <em>bawl-some</em>.”</p>

<p>“That’s great,” laughed Chub.</p>

<p>The conundrums continued until Dick asked one
that broke up the meeting. That was: “How
long will it take to get Chub up in the morning if
we don’t go to bed right away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the easiest yet,” said Roy. “The
answer’s half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Wait, please!” cried Harry. “I’ve just
thought of a lovely one. You know this, papa,
and so you mustn’t guess. What’s the difference
between a spiritualist and a sailor?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that,” said Dick. “It’s something
about ghosts, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you mustn’t tell,” warned Harry.
“Do you know it, Chub?”</p>

<p>“What, that? Huh, that was the first conundrum
I ever made up! I got a prize for that!”</p>

<p>“Then what’s the answer, smarty?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—one goes to sea in the day and the
other goes to see in the dark. Come on, fellows.”</p>

<p>“That’s not right, Chub! Do you all give it
up? Well, the answer is, one sees to ghosts and
the other goes to sea.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that what I said?” demanded Chub
from the steps. “Hasn’t she simply taken the
words from my mouth, Dick?”</p>

<p>“No, she hasn’t,” laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” said Chub aggrievedly, “it isn’t
as nice as one I know about a chestnut.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh, I guess that’s what it is—about a chestnut!”</p>

<p>“Listen, Dickums!” Chub pulled Dick after
him down the steps and held him against the side
of the boat. “I’ll tell you, Dickums, and no one
else. You’ve been a good friend to me. Don’t
squirm so! Give me your full attention. Now:
What’s the difference between a good chestnut
and a bad chestnut? Answer: A worm. Cute,
isn’t it? Laugh, Dickums, laugh, or I’ll drop
you overboard!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning after breakfast Roy and
Dick set out in search of vegetables and eggs,
milk and chickens, the doctor trudged off with
his fishing-rod, and Chub and Harry went to the
store. When they arrived, the curtains in the
windows were still down, and the note still hung
on the door.</p>

<p>“She didn’t get back last night, I guess,” said
Chub, as he unlocked the door and threw it wide
open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334-<br />335]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do wonder when she will come,” murmured
Harry. “Of course we can’t stay here much
longer. Papa said at breakfast that he thought
we ought to try a new fishing-place.”</p>

<p>“My, but he loves to fish, doesn’t he?” laughed
Chub, as he raised the curtains and let the sunlight
in. “Any mail this morning?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” answered Harry. “Let’s take
that list, Chub, and get the things together we’re
to take back to the boat.”</p>

<p>“All right. I wonder what I did with it. If
I’ve gone and lost it—no, here it is. Kerosene—hello!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Harry.</p>

<p>Chub pointed to the counter half-way down the
store. One glance was sufficient for Harry.
With a cry of alarm, she darted to the money-drawer
and pulled it open.</p>

<p>“Oh, Chub!” she wailed despairingly.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p333">The till was empty.</a></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>CLUES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The money was gone from the drawer; boxes,
tins, and packages had been pulled from the
shelves, examined, and either tossed helter-skelter
back or left upon the counters, and on every side
lay evidence of the burglar’s depredations.</p>

<p>“I said we oughtn’t to leave the money here,”
wailed Harry.</p>

<p>Chub didn’t reply. He had seated himself on a
box and was frowning dejectedly about him.</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose did it?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know <em>who</em> did it, but I know how it was
<em>done</em>,” answered Chub. He pointed to the door
into the back yard. The panel nearest the lock
had been splintered in, and the marauder had evidently
thrust his hand through and turned the key
from the inside.</p>

<p>“What shall we say when Mrs. Peel comes?”
asked Harry, miserably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell her the store’s been broken into and
burglarized,” answered Chub, stolidly. “I’ll
make up the money they stole, but I don’t think
I ought to pay for the goods taken. And I imagine,
from the looks of things, that the robbers
took more than twelve dollars’ worth of stuff with
them.”</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it,” mourned Harry.
“We can make up the money between us, for you
know very well, Chub, we aren’t going to let you
pay it all, but we can’t pay for the groceries and
things.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t even any way of finding out how
much they are worth,” replied Chub. “I suppose
I’d better report the robbery to some one. I wonder
where the nearest police station is.”</p>

<p>He got up and walked to the back door, Harry
following him, and examined it.</p>

<p>“Looks as though some one had just kicked his
foot through it, doesn’t it?” he asked. “And
here he goes—hello, there must have been two
of them! You can see the footprints, Harry.
They just climbed the fence here, walked across
to the door, and smashed it in so that one of them
could put his hand through and turn the key.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
And here’s a match.” He picked it up, examined
it, and dropped it into his pocket. “They lighted
a candle or something—”</p>

<p>“There’s a candle over there beside the barrel,”
said Harry. Chub picked it up.</p>

<p>“If it was a new one when they lighted it,” he
said, “they must have been in here a good long
time. I don’t believe a candle burns down that
much in less than twenty minutes or half an hour.
I wonder—”</p>

<p>He broke off and walked to one of the shelves.
A new box of tallow candles had been dragged
from its place, and one candle was missing from
the top layer. Between the counter and the door
he picked up four more matches and added them
to the one in his pocket.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose,” he said thoughtfully, “that
they’ve got any police around here who could
catch these fellows in a hundred years. So I
guess it doesn’t make much difference whether
we report the robbery to-day or next week.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we ought to tell some one right away,
Chub,” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to look around first, anyway.
We ought to get some idea of what’s been taken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
I’m glad I locked the door into the living-rooms.
Here’s the key just where I put it.”</p>

<p>He started around the store, looking into displaced
boxes and cans and returning them to their
places. Presently Harry got a piece of paper and
began to put down a list of the things which they
believed had been taken.</p>

<p>“There were more sides of bacon than this,”
said Chub.</p>

<p>“There were seven,” said Harry. “I noticed
yesterday. They’ve stolen four.”</p>

<p>“Put it down,” said Chub. “And they’ve
made a big hole here in the canned things. Looks
to me as though they’d taken about two dozen
cans. You can see where they took peaches and
green-gage plums. Let’s see; put down six of
each, Harry, and about a dozen more assorted—tomatoes,
beans, and other truck. And sardines,
I guess; I don’t know how many; say three or
four. That’s all they took here, I think.”</p>

<p>He worked around the store, examining, tidying,
and replacing, Harry following anxiously
with her paper and pencil. When they had finished
they breathed easier. It seemed that the
robbers had confined themselves entirely to bacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
and canned goods, although, as Chub allowed, they
might have helped themselves to other things in
small quantities for all they knew. But at most
the value of the things taken would foot up well
under ten dollars.</p>

<p>“Don’t see why they didn’t take more,” mused
Chub. “They had all the time they wanted, apparently.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they had to carry the things a long
way,” Harry suggested. Chub shot a questioning
glance at her.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, they might live a long way off,” Harry
explained. “I don’t believe it was any one who
lives here, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. It might have been a couple of
tramps. The railroad isn’t more than a quarter
of a mile from here, and they may have been
walking along the track and got hungry and came
over to see what they could find. Only, how’d
they know there was no one at home here?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” murmured Harry. “It looks as
though it must have been some one who knew
that Mrs. Peel was away, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Chub, thoughtfully. “Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
whoever they were, they cleaned up the cash-drawer.”
He walked over to it and stared into
it, hands in pocket. “There ought to have been a
lock on it, though I don’t suppose that would have
kept them out.” He turned away, and as he did
so something white on the floor under the counter
caught his eye. Picking it up, he bore it to the
light. It proved to be a crumpled wad of papers.
Chub smoothed them out, revealing Harry’s
memoranda of sales, the letter to Jennie, and the
letter to Mrs. Peel. Both envelopes had been torn
open.</p>

<p>“Guess they thought there might be money in
them,” said Chub. Then—“Look here, Harry,”
he said, “I’m going to read this one to Jennie
and see if Mrs. Peel says when she’s coming
back. Under the circumstances I think it’s allowable,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Harry. “I do. Because she
ought to know what’s happened, and if she isn’t
coming to-day or to-morrow we must write to
her.”</p>

<p>So Chub opened the letter and read it aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jennie</span>:—I found Millie was very much better
when I got here, and there wasn’t any real need of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
my coming, except James was worried and upset and
afraid she was going to be real sick. The doctor was
here about half an hour ago and says she is doing nicely.
It was just a touch of heat, but James thought it was a
fever. She was doing a heavy washing, and the weather
was terribly hot, and she just gave out like a flash. I
tell James he must have a woman to come in Mondays
and help Millie, and he agrees. Unless something unlooked-for
happens, I will be home day after to-morrow
afternoon, and if you have your bag packed you can go
right home the minute I get there, if you want to.
Your aunt Millie sends her love, and so does James.”</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr2">“Your aff. aunt,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Amanda Peel</span>.”<br /></p>
</div>

<p>“When was it written?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Day before yesterday,” Chub answered.
“That means that she will be back to-day. Well,
all the better. I’ve had about all the storekeeping
I want.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” said Harry, dolefully. “And it
was such good fun until this morning, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t bad. You stay here, and I’ll see
if I can find out where the nearest station is.
You aren’t afraid, are you?”</p>

<p>“N—no,” answered Harry, “I’ll stay near
the door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>She had no chance to be lonesome, for ten minutes
after Chub left, almost the entire population
of the village had appeared on the scene, eager
for details of the robbery, anxious to see the
broken door, and highly curious about Harry.
Meanwhile Chub, seated behind Cæsar and beside
Bennie Hooper, was being taken to Washington
Hills and the sheriff. Chub found the sheriff in
the middle of a horse trade in front of the livery-stable.
When, however, he had stated his errand
the horse trade was adjourned, and the sheriff
followed Chub and Bennie back to the scene
of the robbery in his side-bar buggy.</p>

<p>The sheriff was a young, alert man, and Chub
had to own that he seemed quite intelligent. But
he didn’t offer them much hope.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” he said, after he had looked over
the premises and heard all the particulars they
could give him, “that whoever done this job has
got away before this. Tramps, likely as not. It
looks like their sort of work; bungly, you see;
took no pains to hide their tracks. They was
hungry and couldn’t find any place that looked
more promising. Probably had a gunny-sack and
filled it, and then went back to the railroad. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
old lady was lucky they didn’t take more.”</p>

<p>“But doesn’t it seem funny,” asked Chub,
“that they should know the place was empty?”</p>

<p>“Well, you left a note on the door, didn’t you?
Maybe they prowled around, found that, didn’t
see any lights, and concluded they’d take a
chance. Probably they tried the windows and
couldn’t open ’em without breaking the glass, and
then went around back. Well, I’ll see what can
be done. But I guess it’s a hopeless job. Like
as not they’re ten miles or even twenty miles
away by now. Maybe they caught a freight. But
I’ll telegraph up and down the road. You leave
it to me, sir. Tell Mrs. Peel I’ll let her know if
anything comes up.”</p>

<p>He climbed into his buggy and was off again.
They watched him go and then locked the store
and went back to the boat. It was almost noon,
and Dick and Roy had just returned after a fruitful
journey to the neighboring farm.</p>

<p>“We got eggs and chickens and corn and beets
and peas and a whole half-gallon of milk!” called
Dick, jubilantly. “And some little round
squashes that you fry in bread-crumbs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didn’t you bring the things from the store?”
asked Roy.</p>

<p>“No,” Chub answered.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we sort of forgot them. Some
one broke into the store last night and stole the
money and a lot of groceries.”</p>

<p>Presently, when Roy and Dick had heard all
there was to hear, Chub decoyed Roy to the tent,
out of hearing of Harry.</p>

<p>“I say, Roy,” he began, “do you remember
the other night when we found those cans of
peaches on the bed?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Roy.</p>

<p>“Remember we found a lot of matches on the
floor?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Remember what sort they were?”</p>

<p>“What sort? No, just matches, weren’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Parlor matches?”</p>

<p>“Um—no, they were what we used to call ‘all-day
matches,’ the kind that come in cards and have
to be broken off.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, sulphur matches,” agreed Chub.
“Well, look at these.” He drew five burnt
matches from his pocket and held them out.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see,” said Roy. “Look like the same
kind, don’t they? You think, then, that the fellow
that Harry saw at her window is the same
fellow that robbed the store?”</p>

<p>“I think he was one of them,” answered Chub,
decidedly. “Besides, he tried to steal canned
fruit from us, and they took about two dozen
cans of it last night.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Who do you think did it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but—I’ve been wondering—I
say, how far do you think it is to where those
Gipsies are?”</p>

<p>“About two miles, I should say. Now, that’s
it, Chub! I’ll wager they did it!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I think,” said Chub.
“Now, look here. After dinner you and Dick had
better go back to the store with Harry and be
there when Mrs. Peel comes. I’ll give you a
check to replace the stolen money. She won’t lose
that, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll all contribute to that,” said Roy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
“I don’t know that we’re bound to replace it,
though. We didn’t steal it.”</p>

<p>“No, but I’d feel better if we did. You fellows
needn’t help, though; I’ve got enough to pay
for it all.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; we’ll go thirds on it. But what
are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Go fishing,” answered Chub, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Fishing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, up near where the Gipsies are camped.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, you can’t find anything, Chub!”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose I can,” replied Chub, musingly,
“but—well, it won’t do any harm to have a
look around.”</p>

<p>“Let me go with you,” said Roy, eagerly. But
Chub shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll go alone. I want to look around the
camp a bit, and they won’t think much of it if I
stumble in there alone.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think they’ll act badly, do you?” asked
Roy, uneasily.</p>

<p>“No; why should they? They won’t know what
I’m up to. Maybe they won’t see me. We’d
better not let Harry know anything about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
though, because she still thinks she may have
dreamed that chap at her window. If she knows
it really was a man, she’ll be scared to death all
the rest of the time we’re here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what we want to stay here for,
anyhow,” said Roy, disgustedly. “The fishing’s
absolutely no good.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think we’ll move on to-morrow. It
would have saved us money if we’d gone before.
There’s the doctor coming back. I’ll tell him
about it now, so Harry won’t know.”</p>

<p>“Too bad, too bad!” said the doctor, when Chub
had told his story. “But I wouldn’t let it worry
me much. As for the money, why, we can fix that
up easily enough among ourselves. I don’t believe
I’d run any risks, Chub, by poking my
head into that Gipsy camp. They’re an evil-looking
lot. I came by there this morning again
after I’d caught these.” He looked down ruefully
at the string of five small trout which he
carried.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s any danger, sir,” answered
Chub. “Don’t worry; I’ll be back long
before supper-time.”</p>

<p>But Chub was mistaken there.</p>

<small>IN THE GIPSY CAMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">After luncheon Dr. Emery remained in charge
of the boat, Harry and Roy and Dick returned
to the store, and Chub wandered nonchalantly
away with his fishing-pole. Harry declared
that he was as mean as he could be to
desert them now, just when Mrs. Peel was coming
back, but Chub was quite heartless and went off
whistling. At the parting of the roads he waved
them good-by, but Harry refused to notice him.
With a resentful toss of her head she walked
straight on, her little tip-tilted nose held high in
air.</p>

<p>Chub smiled as he turned and took up his journey.
It was the hottest sort of a hot day, and
the road wound on without a speck of shade for
the better part of a mile. He crossed the railroad
and after a while found himself at the summit
of a hill, with the river valley stretching along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
beneath him north and south for as far as the eye
could reach. There was a small group of sumac-bushes
beside the road here, and he threw himself
down in the scanty shade it afforded and
rested for a few minutes. Then he climbed a
stone wall, crossed an upland meadow, and so
came to a stream. It was rather a good-sized
affair and very noisy, for it was hurrying down-hill
over a bed of boulders. Pools were few and
far between here, but he followed the stream up
as it wound around the side of the hill, and eventually
found a place where a big lichen-covered
rock backed the water up into a shallow basin. The
place didn’t look as though it held many trout,
but he selected a fly and made his cast. At the
end of ten minutes or so he had landed a miserable
little fish, not much more than a fingerling, which
under ordinary circumstances he would have disdained
to keep. But it was already approaching
mid-afternoon, and he couldn’t afford to be particular.
Two more youngsters were added to his
string during the next quarter of an hour, and
then Chub decided that he had enough for his
purpose, for he only wanted to convince the Gipsies
that he was a bona fide trout-fisher and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
an emissary of the sheriff’s office. Stringing his
catch on a willow twig, he disjointed his rod and
slipped it back into its case, dropped his fly-book
into his pocket, and took up his journey again.</p>

<p>He kept on around the side of the hill and
presently was back on the road, which had begun
to dip into a narrow valley which divided it from
the higher range of hills to the westward. He
proceeded slowly and cautiously now, for he
didn’t know how near the Gipsy encampment
might be, and he wanted to look it over before he
decided on a course of action. He met no one on
the road save a farmer jogging along half asleep
on top of a load of hay. Presently a speck of
grayish white caught his eye. Surmising it to be
one of the Gipsy tents, he left the road and
plunged into the woods to the right. It was very
still and warm. Once he thought he heard voices
in the direction of the tent, and presently, as he
went softly through the trees and undergrowth,
the gurgling of a stream reached him. He kept
on until he had found it, and then followed along
the bank, feeling pretty certain that it would lead
him to the encampment. Nor was he mistaken,
for fifty yards farther on the tents came into view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
between the trees. He dropped to his hands and
knees and worked cautiously forward until the
undergrowth stopped. There, lying behind a
bush, he reconnoitered.</p>

<p>The spot which the Gipsies had selected for
their camp was an ideal one. On one side lay
the road, on the other the brook. It is probable
that the band had camped there each summer for
a number of years and that their occupancy of
the spot had denuded it of underbrush. At all
events, it was quite clear of bushes and was just
such a place as one would have picked out for a
picnic. The trees were scattered, but gave plenty
of shade; there was a fine turf underfoot; the
road was at their front door and water at their
back.</p>

<p>There were two big, gaily painted vans and five
tents, the latter scattered about apparently at
haphazard. One tent, a circular one and the
largest of the lot, was set in the center of the
grove, and this Chub guessed to be the queen’s
apartment. Here and there clothes hung drying
or airing from the branches, some bales of hay
were piled beside one of the wagons, there was a
pungent odor of smoke from a smoldering fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Chub counted eight horses tethered about where
they could crop the grass. Outside one of the
tents hung a string of baskets, and in the air,
mingling with the odor of the wood-smoke, was a
faint perfume of sweet-grass. Each tent appeared
to have its own fireplace and commissary.
Kettles and pans littered the ground about the
piles of ashes, and here and there dried branches
were heaped for fuel. It was all rather interesting,
and for a moment Chub quite forgot his errand.</p>

<p>There were three men, perhaps twice as many
women, and several children, the children ranging
in age all the way from that of the baby, who
kicked and crowed in his mother’s arms, to that of
the lad of apparently twelve, who was lazily breaking
up fire-wood with an ax at the far side of the
camp. The men were frankly idle, sitting with
pipes in mouth outside one of the tents.</p>

<p>The women, all save the one with the baby, were
busy. One was mixing something for supper in a
flat tin pan, others were weaving baskets, and another
was sewing. Chub had always imagined
Gipsies to be rather picturesque folks, with earrings
and brightly hued costumes. But there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
little of the picturesque about these. The women
wore calico dresses of blue or brown, the men
were clad in things that would have disgraced a
tramp, and the children came into, apparently,
whatever was left. Chub, looking them over, decided
that the doctor was quite right; they certainly
were an evil-looking lot, and he wondered
what their course would be if they suddenly discovered
him lying here behind the bush. They
looked as though they would hesitate at nothing.
And just when he had reached that decision, one
of the men broke into laughter, the others joined
him, and the women smiled in sympathy, the
swarthy faces falling into soft lines and the dark
eyes glinting merrily. Perhaps, Chub reflected,
they were human, after all. This, under the circumstances
in which he found himself, was an
encouraging thought.</p>

<p>He had come there with the idea that possibly
he might catch sight of something which would
prove that the burglary had been performed by
one of their number. He had scarcely expected
to find them seated in a circle dividing the spoils,
but it had not seemed impossible that he might
discover a telltale can of peaches or a side of bacon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
But now, search as he did, not one speck of
incriminating evidence could he see. The only
course remaining, then, was to retrace his steps
through the woods and approach the camp openly
by the road. Perhaps, if he made believe that he
had lost his way and asked them to set him right,
he might get an opportunity to look around the
camp and possibly see inside one or two of the
tents. He might even buy a basket or two. But,
on the point of creeping away, a new plan occurred
to him, a plan which engaged his ardor
because of its sheer recklessness.</p>

<p>The nearest tent was about thirty feet from
where he lay, its back toward him. No sounds
came from it, but he couldn’t be sure that it was
unoccupied, for all of that. Yet, somehow, he believed
that it was. It seemed fair to assume that
the three men in sight were the only ones left in
camp; that the others were away, peddling, dickering
for horses, fishing. Surely no one would
remain in a stuffy tent a hot day like this, he
thought. By creeping a few yards to the left
he would have the tent between him and the Gipsies,
unless some of the children, who were fairly
quiet under the effects of the heat, should take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
it into their heads to roam his way. But that was
a risk he could afford to take, he decided. Once
at the back of the tent, he could easily raise the
canvas and look in. It might be that he would
discover nothing for his pains, but, on the other
hand, he might find a good deal.</p>

<p>Leaving his rod and the fish under the bush
and mentally locating it so that he could recover
them later on, he crept back and made a detour
of a dozen yards toward the road. When he again
reached the edge of the clearing, the tent was in
front of him and the Gipsies out of sight. Pausing
a moment to rest, for creeping on hands and
knees is breath-taking work, he slid stealthily
from cover and crept toward the tent. He didn’t
pause to listen, for the sooner he was behind the
tent the sooner he would be well hidden. But
when he crouched against the soiled canvas he
paused and harkened intently, his heart pounding
against his ribs like a hammer. Only the murmuring
of voices reached him, however, and he
breathed easier.</p>

<p>Putting his head down, he peered under the edge
of the canvas, and his heart gave a throb of triumph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
for there, not a foot from his nose, were a
dozen or more of the stolen cans!</p>

<p>They were piled on the ground at the back of
the tent, the corner of a yellow horse-blanket half
covering them. Chub squirmed until his head
and shoulders were inside the tent, and reached
forward. Beyond the cans were two of the strips
of bacon, wedged in between them and a bale of
hay. Not a sound came from the tent. Noiselessly
Chub drew the rest of his body inside and
peered around the corner of the bale. The tent
was empty. Three beds composed of narrow
straw-filled ticks were in sight, a small old-fashioned
trunk, cooking utensils, some clothes swinging
from the ridge-pole, a couple of empty boxes
on top of one of which lay a pack of dirty playing-cards
and a pile of harness. Chub smiled his
satisfaction and then pondered his next step. If
the stolen groceries were here it was plausible to
suppose that the money was here, too. Of course
it might be in the thief’s pocket, but Chub didn’t
believe that Gipsies were in the habit of carrying
much money around with them. If only he knew
where to look!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>The flap of the tent was open, and through the
opening he could see the woman with the baby,
and two of the children rolling about on the grass.
If, he thought, he could only close the flap! Then
he saw a way of accomplishing that result. By
keeping close to the side of the tent on the right
he would be out of sight of the Gipsies and
could creep around and loosen the flap. So he
dodged back behind the bale of hay to the farther
wall of the tent, and crept along it until he could
reach the flap. It fell into place, cutting off the
shaft of hot sunlight that had flooded the front
of the tent. As it fell, he dropped to the ground
and peeked out under the bottom to see if it had
been noticed. But, save that one of the men had
got to his feet and was standing yawning and
stretching, the inhabitants of the camp were much
as he had seen them last. He waited and watched
until the yawning man had stretched himself out
in the shade and pillowed his face in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360-<br />361]</a></span></p>

<p class="noi">Then he began his search. As rapidly and as
quietly as he could he began at one corner of the
tent and worked around to it again, lifting blankets,
boxes, beds, cooking-utensils, and whatever
else he found. He searched the ticking of the
mattresses for slits through which the money
might have been thrust, and he tipped the bale
of hay up and looked under it. But when he had
completed the circuit of the tent he was forced to
acknowledge defeat, for not a penny of money
had he found. It was hot and stifling since he
had closed the flap, and the perspiration was pouring
from his face, when he finally paused nonplussed
and sought about in vain for some hiding-place
he had overlooked. At that moment
footsteps sounded close beside the tent, shadows
passed across the sloping canvas, and Chub’s
heart jumped into his mouth. With a bound he
reached the bale of hay and tumbled himself behind
it just as the flap was lifted and <a href="#i_p359">two men entered
the tent</a>.</p>

<small>AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE APPEARS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When Roy and Dick and Harry reached the
store they found, to their satisfaction, that
the village inhabitants had gazed their fill and
gone. Roy and Dick amused themselves for a
while in discovering clues and evolving theories,
but that amusement finally palled, and they joined
Harry at the front of the store and awaited the
advent of Mrs. Peel. With the doors open front
and back it was fairly cool, although outside the
sun was baking hot. Two hours wore themselves
away to the slow ticking of the old clock, and Dick
became restless.</p>

<p>“My!” he exclaimed, “I wish the old lady
would come if she’s coming!”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Roy, heartily. “And I wish
I could get a drink of cold water somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Why not use the watering-trough?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Dick. “Come on. I’m thirsty, too. Have
some, Harry?”</p>

<p>But Harry declined, and the boys went out and
held their mouths to the little iron pipe. And
while they were drinking a two-seated carriage
turned the corner and drew up in front of the
store. On the back seat were Mrs. Peel and a tall
man who, in spite of the heat, wore a long black
frock-coat buttoned tightly about his lank form.</p>

<p>“That’s Mrs. Peel!” whispered Roy. “Come
on!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peel climbed nimbly out of the carriage
and entered the store, while her companion remained
to haggle with the driver over the amount
to be paid for the drive from the station. Roy
and Dick entered close behind Mrs. Peel.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” asked Harry, in a small
voice.</p>

<p>“Why, bless me, my dear,” exclaimed Mrs.
Peel, “I didn’t think to find you here!” She
looked about the store. “Where’s Jennie?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t come,” answered Harry, gaining
courage, “and so we’ve been keeping store for
you. And we sold over twelve dollars’ worth of
things—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want to know!” said Mrs. Peel, beamingly.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, but last night some one broke into the
store and stole the money and a lot of things!”</p>

<p>The little woman paled and glanced apprehensively
about her.</p>

<p>“Burglars!” she whispered. “But who—”</p>

<p>“I guess we don’t have to look very far for
’em,” said a voice at the doorway. Roy and
Dick started and looked up. It was the man in
the black frock-coat.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” muttered Roy, softly. “<em>It’s Jim
Ewing!</em>”</p>

<p>“This is my brother-in-law, Mr. Ewing,” faltered
Mrs. Peel. “This young lady is the one I
was telling you about, James, and these gentlemen—they
are friends of yours, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Harry, “we’re all together
with my father and Chub—you saw him the other
day—on a house-boat.”</p>

<p>Roy and Dick were gazing fascinatedly at the
farmer, and Mr. Ewing was staring malevolently
back at them.</p>

<p>“James, there’s been thieves here,” said Mrs.
Peel, “and they stole—how much did they take,
Miss?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>“They took all the money in the drawer,” said
Harry, “and we reckoned up that they’d taken
about nine dollars’ worth of bacon and canned
goods. They broke in the back door—”</p>

<p>“Up to your old tricks again, are ye?” asked
Mr. Ewing, harshly. “Ain’t content with robbing
farms, eh? Have to take the bread out of
the mouths of the widows and orphans, too, do
ye?”</p>

<p>“Why, James!” ejaculated Mrs. Peel, bewilderedly.
“You don’t understand! These aren’t
the thieves! These gentlemen are—”</p>

<p>“Don’t need to tell me anything about ’em,”
grunted the farmer. “We’ve met before, ain’t
we?”</p>

<p>“We have,” replied Roy, dryly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t think you’d dare deny it,” was the
triumphant response. “Well, I guess we’ve met
once too frequent for your good, you young rascals!
I guess—”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean, James?” cried Mrs.
Peel, nervously.</p>

<p>“Mean? Mean that these folks is a parcel of
thieves, that’s what I mean, Amanda! Travel
around country, they do, in some sort of a floatin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
robbers’ den. They broke into my house early
in the spring and stole more’n thirty dollars
worth of silverware. And then here a while ago,
when Millie was up visiting you, they come around
again, and I found ’em at their tricks and pretty
nigh got ’em. But this time I’ll wager they’ll
get what they deserve. You go out, Amanda, and
send some one for the constable.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Peel was beyond running errands.
She subsided into a chair and fanned herself with
her bonnet, looking dazed and frightened.</p>

<p>“You said they was friends of yours,” she
whispered weakly to Harry.</p>

<p>“They are,” replied Harry, stoutly and indignantly,
“and this gentleman is quite mistaken.
The store was robbed last night, while we were
all asleep on the boat or in the tent.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” chuckled the farmer.
“You didn’t know anything about it, young lady;
I don’t say <em>you</em> did. But I guess these fellers
here can pretty nigh put their hands on the things
if they want to. Where’s the other chap?” he
demanded of Roy.</p>

<p>“He’s—he’s fishing,” answered Roy.</p>

<p>“Fishin’, eh? Carried a bag along with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
didn’t he? To bring the fish home in, eh? Yes,
he’s fishin’, I’ll be bound—fishin’ in hen-coops,
likely! Got a room where we can lock ’em in,
Amanda, till the constable comes?”</p>

<p>“Why, James, I—I—don’t know what to think!
I’m sure these young gentlemen wouldn’t do
such a thing! And—and even if there is a few
things missing,” she continued, nervously, “I—I
wouldn’t want to make any trouble, James.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to,” he replied, grimly. “I’ll
make the trouble. Now you get up and march
into the house, right through that side door
there.” This to Roy and Dick.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Ewing,” said Roy, calmly,
“you’ve made a fool of yourself once before, and
it’s time to quit. We weren’t robbing your
house that other time, and we don’t know any
more about this affair than we’ve told you. And
if you think we’re going to let you lock us up in a
stuffy old room just so you can make a goose of
yourself, you’re mightily mistaken. Come on,
Harry, and leave this crazy man to himself.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” cried the farmer. “You stay
where you are! I’m going to have the law on
you, I say! Don’t you defy the law now! Don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
you do it! If you do it’ll go hard with you, I
tell you that! I’ve warned ye!”</p>

<p>“James,” gasped Mrs. Peel, “don’t be violent!
Just—just let’s hear what they have to say. You
tell me, my dear, all about it.”</p>

<p>“Then he mustn’t call Roy and Dick thieves,”
answered Harry, angrily. “He’s a horrid old
man, whoever he is.”</p>

<p>“Tell Mrs. Peel all about it, Harry,” said Roy,
in a bored tone. “See if you can make her understand.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harry, pausing a moment to collect
her thoughts, “it was like this.” And she
told the story of the burglary from the time of
Mrs. Peel’s departure to the station to her return.
Mr. Ewing sniffed and snorted at intervals, and
Dick looked several times as though he was having
hard work to refrain from pitching into him,
but Mrs. Peel listened attentively to every word,
and when the narrative was finished turned in
triumph to her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>“There, James,” she said. “I told you you
were mistaken. And these young gentlemen have
put the money back in the drawer—which I’m
sure they aren’t beholden to do—and it’s there
now.”</p>

<p>“A check!” scoffed the farmer. “I reckon I
wouldn’t count too much on any piece of paper
they give you.” But it was to be seen, nevertheless,
that Mr. Ewing was somewhat shaken in
mind, for it would have been very difficult for any
one to have disbelieved Harry’s story.</p>

<p>“Oh, if that’s all that’s troubling you,” said
Roy, “we’ll give you the cash instead.”</p>

<p>“And how about the other things you stole?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t steal them. And I guess you’ll
have to look for them yourself,” said Roy, wearily.</p>

<p>“And how about my silverware?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother your silverware!” exploded Dick.
“I don’t believe you ever owned any! Anyhow,
I’m sick of hearing about it. Come on, Roy,
let’s mosey along.”</p>

<p>But the farmer strode to the door, closed it,
turned the key in the lock, and dropped the key
into his pocket.</p>

<p>“<a href="#Page_369">You’ll stay where you are</a> a bit longer,” he
snarled. “I ain’t decided yet what to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
you.” Then, before either Roy or Dick remembered
the back door, he had headed them off in
that direction as well, and, with both keys in his
pocket, was master of the situation.</p>

<small>MR. EWING IS SUSPICIOUS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dick looked eagerly at Roy, but Roy shook his
head. So far they had done nothing to
merit punishment, but if they set on the farmer
he would have good cause for complaint against
them. Besides, as Roy realized, it was doubtful
if they could overcome Mr. Ewing in a tussle.
Roy perched himself on the counter again and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You’re making a fool of yourself,” he said,
“just as I begged you not to do.” The farmer
paid no heed to him.</p>

<p>“You get your things off, Amanda,” he said,
“and look around and see just what’s gone. I
reckon if these fellers own up to nine dollars’
worth you’ll find a heap more than that missing!”</p>

<p>“You’re a horrid, ugly, suspicious old man!”
cried Harry, hotly. “And just as soon as I get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
back to the boat I’m going to tell my father on
you!”</p>

<p>Mr. Ewing regarded her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Father’s with you, is he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is!”</p>

<p>“Guess you and your father wasn’t with these
fellers a while back, was you? When they stopped
and paid me a visit?”</p>

<p>“No, but we know all about it. The boys only
stopped at your place to buy some milk, and your
dog got after them and drove them into the
house.”</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t saying you’ve got anything to
do with this,” said the farmer, quite kindly.
“And if you want to run along home I ain’t got
no objections, Miss.”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t go until you let Roy and Dick go,”
replied Harry, spiritedly. “You haven’t any
right to keep us here.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t keeping you, Miss. I offered to let
you out. You run along, Amanda, and do as I
tell you to. The sooner we find out what’s missing,
the better.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Peel, arising with a sigh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
“I don’t know what to say, James. It don’t seem
to me as you’re doing right.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about me, Amanda. I’ll
stand good for my actions.”</p>

<p>With another sigh and a troubled, doubtful
look about her, the little woman went toward the
door into the living-rooms.</p>

<p>“You’ll find the key on the third shelf at the
right,” said Harry. “We locked the door yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Might as well have a look around in there,
too,” advised Mr. Ewing. “Maybe they’ve been
collectin’ silverware again.”</p>

<p>Dick groaned loudly, and the farmer cast a baleful
look at him as Mrs. Peel disappeared. Harry
joined the boys, and they discussed the situation
in whispers, while Mr. Ewing stood guard near
the front door.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of being huffy?” asked Roy.
“It’s nothing but a lark, anyway.”</p>

<p>“But look at the time,” said Dick. “Six
o’clock already, and I’m as hungry as a bear.
And the doctor will wonder what’s become of
us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s so. I say, Harry, you’d better run
along to the boat and bring the doctor and Chub
with you. There’s no use in missing our supper
just to please this old galoot.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will,” answered Harry. “I guess
when papa comes he will have something to say
to this man!” She shot a vindictive look at the
unperturbed Mr. Ewing. “If you’ll kindly unlock
the door,” she announced, haughtily, “I’ll
go.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the farmer, “but you fellers
just stay where you be; understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we understand,” replied Roy. “We
won’t try to rush you. Don’t you suppose we
could get out of here if we wanted to try?”</p>

<p>“Maybe; maybe not,” answered Mr. Ewing, as
he unlocked the door. “Anyhow, you’d better
not try it.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” called Harry. “I’ll bring papa
right back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, take your time,” replied Roy, with a wave
of his hand. “We’re quite comfortable. Besides,
we have the inestimable pleasure of Mr.
Ewing’s society.”</p>

<p>The door closed again, and the farmer returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the key grimly to his pocket. After a few minutes
Mrs. Peel returned.</p>

<p>“Not a thing’s gone from the house, James,”
she announced.</p>

<p>“Are you certain sure?” asked Mr. Ewing.</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” she replied, tartly.</p>

<p>“Well, now you take a look around the store.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peel proceeded to do so. When she came
to the money-drawer she found the check which
Harry had placed there. She brought it to Mr.
Ewing, and the latter looked it all over carefully.</p>

<p>“It looks perfectly good, don’t it, James?” she
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, it <em>looks</em> all right,” he acknowledged,
grudgingly, “but it’s the best-lookin’ checks
that’s the worthlessest. Horace Collins, over to
Highwood, took a check like this from a stranger
once, and it wa’n’t a bit of good. Came back to
him marked right across the face of it, ‘No funds.’
You can’t ever tell by <em>lookin’</em> at a check what it’s
<em>worth</em>, Amanda.”</p>

<p>Roy and Dick sat on the edge of the counter
and swung their heels and grinned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peel continued her investigation, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
she was through she did some figuring, dipping
the little stump of a pencil at frequent intervals
into the corner of her mouth. Finally:</p>

<p>“It’s just as they said, James,” she announced.
“I can’t see as anything’s missing except
the canned things and the bacon. And that
foots up to just eight dollars and forty cents.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” said Mr. Ewing, in tones
which belied his assertion. “It might have been
a heap worse.” He turned to the boys. “If
Amanda’s willing to take that money in cash instead
of paper and let you off, I ain’t got anything
more to say. If I was her I’d have ye all
put in jail, but women-folks are soft-hearted and
easy-goin’, and it’s for her to say.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mrs. Peel, hurriedly, “this
check may be all right. I don’t get many of them,
you see, and don’t pretend to be able to tell the
good ones from the bad. But James says it’s
risky, and so if you gentlemen wouldn’t mind just
giving me the money instead—”</p>

<p>“We’d do it in a minute for you, ma’am,”
Roy answered, “but this gentleman here has got
on my nerves. So I guess that, seeing we aren’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
liable for that money anyway, it’ll have to be the
check or nothing.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you agree—” began the farmer, angrily.</p>

<p>“There, there, James,” Mrs. Peel soothed.
“There ain’t any cause to pursue the subject.
They’re right, I guess; they ain’t bound to pay
back what the burglars took, and I don’t know
as I ought to take the money from them.” She
laid the check on the edge of the counter and observed
it dubiously.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, ma’am,” said Dick. “We
want you to have it. We’ve made it up between
us. It wasn’t our fault that the store was broken
into, but still we were left in charge, after a fashion,
and we’d feel better about it if you let us
pay.”</p>

<p>Farmer Ewing laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Gettin’ out of it pretty cheap at that, I guess,”
he sneered. “If it was my store—”</p>

<p>“Oh, see here, now, if it was your store you’d
have had no customers!” broke out Roy.</p>

<p>Further hostilities were interrupted by a knock
at the door. Mr. Ewing turned the key and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
looked out. Then the door swung open, and the
doctor and Harry appeared.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the doctor, gravely and quietly,
“what’s going on here, pray?”</p>

<p>“Is he your father?” asked the farmer of Harry.
She nodded.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll explain to him,” said Mr. Ewing.
He started in and had reached the robbery of his
farm in June, when his silverware had been taken,
when the doctor smiled and held up his hand.</p>

<p>“One moment, sir,” said the doctor. “I happen
to know exactly where all three of these
young gentlemen were during the first three weeks
of June, and it is quite impossible that they
could have had anything to do with taking your
silver. As for the time they visited your farm
and were found by you in your house, their explanation
is quite truthful. I’ve known them all
for periods of from three to five years, sir, and
I assure you that you can believe what they tell
you. As for attempting to connect them with the
recent burglary here, why, that is quite absurd.
I think, Mr. Ewing, that you have allowed your
imagination to run away with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sounds mighty fine,” growled Mr. Ewing,
“but how do I know who you are?”</p>

<p>“My name is Emery, sir, and I’m principal
of the Ferry Hill School at Ferry Hill, which, as
you probably know, is only a short distance down
the river from here. These boys have all been
my pupils, and this young lady is my daughter.
Now, boys, I guess we’d better get back to supper.”</p>

<p>Dick and Roy followed the doctor to the door,
Mr. Ewing offering no objection. At that moment
there was the sound of an automobile horn,
and a big gray car swept down the road and
stopped with a jarring of brakes in front of the
store. In the front seat sat Chub and Joe Whiting;
in the back of the car were the sheriff and
three chaps of about Whiting’s age.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” cried Chub, cheerily. “Mrs.
Peel in? Tell her we’ve got pretty nearly all her
stuff, and what we couldn’t find we’ve brought
the money for!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>CHUB’S ADVENTURE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was after eight o’clock, and they were back
at camp, eating a much-delayed supper and
listening to the story of Chub’s adventures.</p>

<p>“I just had time to get behind that bale of hay
with the horse-blanket over it when they came into
the tent. I thought sure they’d seen me! I
made myself as small as possible and felt around
for the bottom of the canvas, thinking every minute
they’d reach down and pull me out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you were scared!” laughed Roy.</p>

<p>“I was,” acknowledged Chub. “You’d have
been scared, too.”</p>

<p>“Then what happened?” asked Harry, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Now, if Dickums will cut a few more slices
of bread I’ll proceed with the narrative. I’m as
hungry as a bear!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Chub proceeded, as he buttered another
slice of bread and helped himself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
stewed apricots, “I got my feet through under
the bottom of the tent and squirmed out until I
just had my head inside. I wasn’t going to leave
that there, but just then the two Gipsies began
shouting and quarreling with each other, and I
was pretty certain that they didn’t know I was
around. So I stayed still a moment and listened.
I couldn’t understand more than one word in
three, for they used the funniest language I ever
heard, but I didn’t have any trouble making out
that one chap wanted money and the other didn’t
want to give it to him. I thought every minute
they were going to fight, but they didn’t; just
romped around and called each other things in
Gipsy language—and sometimes in English—and
raised all sorts of a rumpus. I thought you could
have heard them a quarter of a mile away, and I
wondered why the other folks didn’t come over
to see what was up. But I suppose they’re used
to it. Presently I got my head outside, too, but in
such a position that I could see in under the canvas
and hear everything.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon they calmed down, and I heard
one of them saying something about a dollar, and
the other fellow saying ‘Two dollars! Two dollars!’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
over and over. And finally one of them
hove in sight, and I ducked quick. I heard him
fussing around back of the bale of hay, and
thought he was getting some of the canned things
for supper. I lifted the canvas a little way and
saw that he wasn’t looking toward me at all. He
was leaning over the bale and pulling a piece of
brown paper out between the layers of hay. When
he had it out he opened it, and I felt like kicking
myself. For there were bills and silver and coppers
wrapped up in it, and I knew it was the
money I’d been looking for. But I kept still and
watched. He took a two-dollar bill out of the
bunch, did the rest up, and put it back where it
had been before, shoving his hand ’way into the
hay. Then he went off, and I heard them squabbling
again, only they weren’t so peevish now.</p>

<p>“Then, thinks I, it’s my time. So I squirmed
back until I had my head and shoulders in the
tent again. By stretching I could reach the bale,
and in the shake of a lamb’s tail I had that little
bundle of money in my pocket. Then I thought
it would be a good scheme to have a look at the
chaps so I could tell them again. That’s where
I made my mistake, for, just as I got my head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
around the corner, one of the fellows got up off
the box he’d been sitting on and looked my way.
I saw him all right, and the other fellow too, but
he saw me, which wasn’t down on the program.
I saw his eyes get big and his hand shoot out toward
me, pointing, and I heard him break into
song, but I didn’t wait any longer. I sneaked.
I got tangled up in backing out, and lost some time
that way, but I got out before they reached me,
and was up and running like the dickens for the
woods.</p>

<p>“Well, you never heard such a row as there
was! I hadn’t got half-way to cover when the
whole place was in an uproar and everybody in
that camp was coming after me. The fellows in
the tent came, too; one through the back and the
other by way of the door. It was a merry chase,
fellows! I made for the deep woods and then circled
around toward the road, thinking I could
outrun any of them if I had a good track. But I
was off my reckoning. I reached the road all
right and had a few yards’ start, when the chap
who had seen me broke out of the woods and
came after me like a house afire. And he can
run, that Gipsy! If we had him at college we’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
win the sprints easily! I put on every ounce
of steam I had, but he kept gaining on me, and I
saw that it was no use. Then I made a dive for
the woods again, thinking I might manage to give
him the slip. But instead of that I gave myself
the slip. I tumbled over a root or something,
and before I could get my feet again he had me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Chub!” gasped Harry. “Did he hurt
you?”</p>

<p>“Cut his head off,” said Dick. “Look for
yourself, Harry.”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t hurt me, that is, not to mean
it. He pretty nearly broke my back when he
landed on me, but that was unintentional, I suppose.
By the time I’d got up, about six more
of the Indians were on the scene, all talking and
jabbering away like mad. No one seemed to
know what the trouble was, and the chap who had
me couldn’t get them to keep still long enough
to let him tell them. I never heard such a lot of
noise in my life. Sounded like a meeting of the
Football Rules Committee. Well, they held on
to me and shouted and yelled, and I got my breath
back and tried to put on a front.</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean by chasing me like this?’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
said I. ‘Let me go immediately’—or words to
that effect. ‘What you do in my tent?’ asks the
pasty-faced gentleman who had caught me. ‘What
tent?’ says I, looking as innocent as anything.
Then they all broke out again, and pointed, and
began to lug me back to their old camp. I went
unwillingly, but I went; that is, I went part way.
Because, just as we were getting back to it, along
comes a cloud of dust with an automobile in it.
So I began to yell like anything: ‘<em>Help! Murder!
Fire! Thieves!</em>’ And, being a human sort of an
automobile, it stopped quick to see what was up.
When the dust had blown away I looked up to
find Joe Whiting grinning down at me in surprise.</p>

<p>“‘Well, what the dickens are you doing here,
Eaton?’ he asked.</p>

<p>“‘Having my fortune told,’ said I. ‘And I
don’t like the way it’s turning out.’</p>

<p>“Well, Whiting had three friends with him—they
were touring, it seemed—and it wasn’t more
than half a minute until I was in the car with
them. The Gipsies didn’t want to let me go.
They said I’d been caught stealing; they can talk
good enough English when they want to; and they
were going to have me arrested. But the fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
said I was a particular friend of theirs, and they
couldn’t spare me. Whiting sort of wanted to
get out and break up the camp, but I told him I
knew something that would be more fun than that.
So we went on, and I told him all about everything;
how I’d found the stolen things and the
money, and all we had to do was to get the sheriff
and go back there and get them. Whiting said
they weren’t in any particular hurry, and they’d
run over to Washington Hills and bring the sheriff
back. So we did it. Found the sheriff washing
up for supper, got him into the car, and hustled
him back. The rest was easy. He just
showed those Gipsies his badge and the handle of
his revolver, and they said, ‘Welcome to our city.’
We hunted through the whole place and got everything
except a few cans of vegetables and two
strips of bacon. Then the sheriff threatened to
arrest every one if they didn’t pay up for what
was missing and move out of the township before
to-morrow night. And they agreed to everything.
We threw the booty into the automobile, said
good night, and kited for the store.”</p>

<p>“Well, you had a busy and eventful afternoon,”
said the doctor, when Chub had ended. “It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
a lucky thing that your friends came just as they
did. I’m afraid you’d have fared badly otherwise.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’d have hurt me, sir,” answered
Chub. “You see, they didn’t know I’d
taken the money; they didn’t find that out until
the sheriff told them. And I don’t believe they’d
have thought of it. I think they’d have let me go
after a while.”</p>

<p>“It did me good,” laughed Dick, “to see the expression
on old Jim Ewing’s face when you
lugged the stuff into the store. He was a picture.”</p>

<p>“The old ruffian!” growled Roy.</p>

<p>“Well, he saw the error of his way,” said
Chub, cheerfully. “And he came as near apologizing
as it was possible for him to, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Said he’d made a mistake; we could have told
him that before,” muttered Roy. “I hope he—”
Roy glanced at the doctor and gulped. “I hope
he loses his train.” The others laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Peel apologized for him, anyway,”
said Dick. “She’s a nice old lady. She was so
excited she didn’t know what was happening, especially
when Whiting bought the dozen cans of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
tomatoes. What did he want with those, Chub?”</p>

<p>Chub chuckled.</p>

<p>“I asked him, and he said they were fine to set
up on the fence-posts and shoot at with revolvers.
Said every time you hit one the blood came. He’s
a good chap, fellows. We must look him up when
we get back to college.”</p>

<p>“We sure must!” said Roy, vehemently.
“Come on and let’s get these things washed up.
It’s ’most time for bed.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” remarked the doctor, as he pushed
Snip off his lap and arose—“I wonder if you boys
know what the date is.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, the fifth,” replied Chub, promptly.</p>

<p>“Sixth, isn’t it?” asked Roy, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Seventh,” said Dick, as though he really
knew.</p>

<p>“The seventh it is,” replied the doctor, “the
seventh of August. Does that suggest anything
to any one?” He looked around the circle smilingly.
But every one looked utterly blank, every
one save Harry; she looked uneasy, as though she
would have liked to change the subject of conversation.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s birthday?” asked Roy, vaguely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>“Labor Day!” exclaimed Dick, and was
promptly hooted.</p>

<p>“No, it’s nothing particular on the Gregorian
calendar,” said the doctor, “but it’s an important
day on my calendar, I might say <em>our</em> calendar.”
And he laid his arm over Harry’s shoulders and
pulled her to him.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t Harry’s birthday,” said Chub,
“because she—”</p>

<p>“And it isn’t the doctor’s,” Dick interrupted,
“because that comes in February. We—we observed
it last time.” And Dick smiled doubtfully
at the doctor.</p>

<p>“You did indeed,” replied the latter, dryly, to
the accompaniment of Harry’s laughter.</p>

<p>“What did you do?” asked Chub, gleefully.</p>

<p>“They serenaded me,” said the doctor, with
one of his slow smiles. “The music was really
nice, but, as it happened at half-past six in the
morning, I was obliged to interrupt it. In fact,
I was obliged to interview some half-dozen of the
leaders at the office. And our friend Dick, here,
was one of them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we didn’t mind, sir,” replied Dick, cheerfully.
“You see,” he explained, turning to Chub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
with a reminiscent grin, “we got up early, about
twenty of us, and went to the cottage. There
were about eight of us who could play things, and
we had two violins, three banjos, a concertina, and—and—”</p>

<p>“A clarionet!” prompted Harry, her eyes dancing.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we made pretty good music. We
played ‘Boola’ and ‘Dixie’ and something else.
They weren’t especially appropriate, of course,
but we had to play what we all knew, or what
most of us knew. We were just in the middle
of the third number on the program, with everything
going finely and the clarionet skipping every
third or fourth note, when up went a window and
out popped the doctor’s head. ‘What does this
mean?’ he asked, very sternly. Then we all
cheered and made noises on the fiddles and things,
and yelled, ‘Happy birthday, Doctor!’ And the
doctor told us to go back to the dormitory instantly.
And we went.”</p>

<p>“And then you went to the office after breakfast,
eh?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Dick, carelessly, “but the
doctor didn’t really mean half he said!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Emery’s laughter mingled with that of the
others.</p>

<p>“But you haven’t guessed my riddle yet,” he
reminded them.</p>

<p>“I give it up, sir,” said Chub. “The seventh
of August doesn’t mean a thing to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, we wish it didn’t to us, don’t we, Harry?”
Harry nodded sorrowfully. “It’s the
end of our two weeks’ cruise on the <i>Slow Poke</i>,”
said the doctor. “It’s the day we were due
home.”</p>

<p>“O—oh!” exclaimed the boys in chorus.</p>

<p>“Can’t you stay a little longer, sir?” asked
Chub, eagerly. But the doctor shook his head
with decision before Harry could get out the
words on her tongue.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid not, Chub. I’ve an engagement
at home the day after to-morrow and some
things to look up first. I ought to have been
back to-day, I suppose, but I think one day won’t
matter. Do you think you can get us back to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Easy, sir, if you really must go,” answered
Chub. But Dick shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>“Why not?” challenged Roy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you see, the engine hasn’t been working
very well of late, and I shouldn’t be a bit surprised
if it just stopped entirely to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Get out! You haven’t had it going for
days!” said Roy. “How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Feel it,” answered Dick, gravely. “I—I
have a premonition.”</p>

<p>“And how long do you think it will be before
the engine gets to working again?” asked the doctor,
with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Probably about a week, sir,” replied Dick,
slyly.</p>

<p>“A very intelligent engine,” said the doctor,
with a smile. “You have a talk with it to-night,
Dick, and explain to it that I am obliged to be at
home to-morrow. Maybe it will decide to go on
with us. You might say, that if I can’t get home
on the <i>Slow Poke</i> I’ll have to ferry across and
take the train.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Dick, regretfully, “it—it
might postpone its breakdown until later. But I
feel sure that it won’t last longer than it takes
to reach Ferry Hill.”</p>

<p>“Goody!” cried Harry. “Then you can stay
and pay us a visit, can’t they, papa?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re going to,” he answered. “They’re
going to stay with us at least a week, aren’t you,
boys?”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other questioningly.
Finally:</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” said Chub, “if the others—”</p>

<p>“We’d all like to,” said Roy. “And we will
if you’re sure you don’t mind, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Mind! Of course I won’t mind! Why, Mrs.
Emery wouldn’t forgive me if I let you go back
without a real visit.”</p>

<p>“If they don’t come,” said Harry, “I won’t
speak to them again ever!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re coming,” said Chub. “We’ll sleep
aboard the boat, doctor, so that Mrs. Emery won’t
have to bother about us much.”</p>

<p>“Just as you like about that, boys, but you’ll
take your meals at the cottage; that’s understood.
How much longer is your cruise going to last,
Chub?”</p>

<p>Chub looked doubtfully at the others.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, finally, “this is the seventh,
and if we stay at the school a week that will bring
it to about the middle, won’t it? Then if we went
back to New York slowly we could make the trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
last to about the twentieth. And, as far as I’m
concerned, I think I’d be ready to quit by that
time.”</p>

<p>“That’s long enough,” said Dick.</p>

<p>Roy agreed with him. “We’ll have been gone
over six weeks by that time,” he said. “And
there’s no use prolonging a good time till you
begin to get tired of it.”</p>

<p>“And there’s no use staying up all night,” said
Dick, with a yawn. “I wager you’ll dream the
Gipsies have got you to-night, Chub.”</p>

<p>“If I do,” answered Chub, “you’ll hear me!”</p>

<small>GIFTS AND FAREWELLS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The next morning camp was broken and the
<i>Slow Poke</i> was made ready for the cruise to
Ferry Hill. Chub and Harry left Dick to fiddle
with his beloved engine and Roy to help him, and
paid a farewell visit to Mrs. Peel. They found
the little woman busily and contentedly engaged
about the store, armed with a feather duster.
Chub’s gasoline sign still challenged the passing
traffic from the corner of the building.</p>

<p>“I’m just going to let it stay right there,” said
Mrs. Peel, when Chub offered to get it down for
her. “When you can buy gasoline for twelve or
fourteen cents by the barrel and sell it for twenty
cents a gallon, I think it pays real well. And
you’d be surprised the number of automobiles
go by here! I’ve been keeping track of them
this morning, and there’s been three already.
Didn’t any of them want any gasoline, I guess;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
leastways, they didn’t stop; but maybe the next
one will; you never can tell. I took the sign out
of the window, though,” she added, apologetically.
“It didn’t seem just the thing, although it was
certainly printed just lovely. I was wondering
if you’d mind doing me another one instead. I
was making up my mind to ask you, in case you
came back again, just when you crossed the
street.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to,” said Chub. “What shall I
print?”</p>

<p>“Well,”—Mrs. Peel folded her arms and
pursed her lips—“I’ve heard folks say that down
to Washington Hills it’s hard to get waited on
at that store, and that half the time they get
short weight. I guess that’s how that fellow
down there can sell as cheap as he does. I
thought you might just put on the sign, ‘Prompt
attention, honest prices, full measure.’ What do
you think?”</p>

<p>“That’s lovely,” said Harry, “and it’s all
true, too!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Peel, beaming at the compliment,
“I always have held that it pays to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
treat folks fair and square, leastway in the long
run. That fellow down to Washington Hills
is doin’ pretty well now, but I wouldn’t be
surprised if he got into trouble before many years
are gone. Folks don’t mind being cheated for
awhile, but they get tired of it in the end. There
was a man came here last Fall with a lot of signs
he wanted me to buy; cards, they were, that you
put in the window and around the store. Awfully
pretty, too; looked like pictures, most. But I
didn’t take to them. Mostly they was signs like
‘Our Prices can’t be Beat’ and ‘As good as Any,
Better’n Many’ and ‘Our Prices are the Lowest
in Town.’ Well, course that last was true enough,
because this is the only store here, but most of
them was sort of prevaricating. I told the man
so. I said if he had any real honest signs to fetch
’em out and I’d look at ’em. But, if you’ll believe
it, he didn’t have one! My husband used to
say that you could cheat a man once, and maybe
twice, but you couldn’t cheat him the third time
because he wouldn’t give you a chance. And I
guess that’s about the way it is. I’ll get a nice
big piece of cardboard, sir, and the marking pot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>Chub took particular pains with that sign, ruling
his lines and spacing his letters with a pencil
before he set to work with the brush and the
lampblack. And when it was finished it certainly
looked fine.</p>

<p>“There,” said Chub, holding it out, “that isn’t
so bad, is it? I’ve seen signs right in the windows
of our stores at home that didn’t beat that
much. That capital F looks sort of wobbly, but
you wouldn’t notice it, I think.”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly splendid!” said Harry, admiringly.
And Mrs. Peel, who had watched the
lettering with an almost breathless interest, fluttered
off, in quite a tremor of excited pleasure, to
find her spectacles.</p>

<p>“Looks just like it was printed on a printing-machine,”
she exclaimed, when her glasses had
been adjusted and she was alternately trying the
effects of looking through them and over them.
“I’m very much obliged, sir. I—I think I’ll
put it in the window and see how it looks from
outside.”</p>

<p>So, with Chub assisting, she tacked it to the
back of one of the window shelves, and cleared
the one below so that the inscription should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
be missed. Then she hurried out to the sidewalk
and viewed it with her head perked about like a
bird’s. Chub and Harry joined her and observed
the effect with satisfaction, and Chub, to Mrs.
Peel’s delight, discovered that it could be read
from the corner of the street if you found just
the right spot to stand.</p>

<p>They made a few modest purchases for the
boat’s larder and then bade Mrs. Peel good-by.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “I do hope you’ll come
again. You’ve been most kind and obliging, all
of you. I do hope you won’t hold it against me,
the way James acted. He’s a real nice man,
’cept when he gets his tantrums, and then he’s
that set and—and pig-headed there isn’t any use
trying to argue with him.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s so,” murmured Chub.</p>

<p>“Indeed, we didn’t mind him at all, did we,
Chub?” assured Harry.</p>

<p>“No’m, not a bit,” Chub replied. “I—I hope
he got his train all right last night?”</p>

<p>“He must have, I guess. If he hadn’t he’d
been back again likely. He was real ashamed
of the way he’d acted and the things he’d said,
but wild horses couldn’t get him to own up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
it, Miss. Some men are like that. You have to
know them, Miss. My husband used to say
that there was two ways to judge a man. One
way was to watch him in public, and the other
way was to see him at home. I’ve seen
James at home. Well, must you really be going?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Chub, “they’ll be waiting
for us at the boat, I’m afraid. Good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, sir. Good-by, Miss. I do hope
you’ll come up this way again, and—and—”
The little woman broke off vaguely and swept her
gaze quickly about the store. Then, “Just you
wait a bit, please, Miss,” she exclaimed. She
trotted back to the ribbon-case, casting a backward
glance at Harry’s face, and fumbled agitatedly
about there for a moment. Then she
came back with a roll of light-blue ribbon which
she put in Harry’s hand.</p>

<p>“To tie up your hair, my dear,” she whispered,
patting the hand that held the gift.</p>

<p>“Oh, but really, Mrs. Peel—”</p>

<p>“Now don’t you say anything, Miss! It’s just
a little remembrance from an old woman you’ve
been kind to. ’Tain’t worth a row of pins.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
And while Harry was thanking her she turned to
Chub.</p>

<p>“Ain’t there any little thing you’d like to take
along, sir?” she asked, eagerly. “I do wish
you’d select something. I suppose there isn’t
much here you’d care for, but—”</p>

<p>“Indeed there is, Mrs. Peel,” Chub assured her
heartily, “but I’m not going to take anything.
I thank you just the same.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peel’s eyes were ranging the store again,
and Chub nudged Harry and moved toward the
door.</p>

<p>“Just a minute, sir!” And Mrs. Peel hurried
away to one of the farther shelves, returning in
a moment, looking highly pleased with herself.
“There,” she said, “just you take that, sir. It’s
a real pretty bit of china, ain’t it? Course that
sentiment don’t mean anything. Unless,” she
added, half shyly, “you want it should, sir.”</p>

<p>The gift was a pale pink mustache-cup, decorated
with green leaves and purple flowers, and
bearing the inscription in funny gilt lettering,
“Friendship’s Token.” Chub glanced at Harry,
whose eyes were dancing merrily and yet looked
a trifle misty, and then at Mrs. Peel. Apparently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
however, that lady was quite unaware of the
irony of presenting Chub with a mustache-cup,
and Chub restrained a smile and thanked her quite
gravely and earnestly. When they reached the
corner with their gifts and purchases, they turned
and looked back. The little woman was in the
doorway, smiling and waving her feather duster.
<a href="#i_p405">They waved back to her and went on.</a> Harry
was silent until they were taking the hill. Then:</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” she said, half aggressive and
half apologetic. “I think it was perfectly sweet
of her, Chub!”</p>

<p>“Of course it was,” answered Chub, emphatically.</p>

<p>“And—and it shows,” continued Harry, earnestly,
“that the world is just full of nice people,
and you can’t always tell who they are at—at
first.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘The world is so full of a number of things,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I’m sure we should all be as happy as kings,’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">murmured Chub, adding, with a glance at Harry’s
ardent face, “Anyhow, ’most any one could be
nice to you without half trying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406-<br />407]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why?” asked Harry, opening her blue eyes
very wide. Chub’s gaze wandered off to the
scenery.</p>

<p>“Oh, just—just because,” he answered,
vaguely.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shortly before ten the <i>Slow Poke</i> was on her
way again, dropping down the river with, for the
<i>Slow Poke</i>, almost marvelous speed.</p>

<p>“At this rate,” sighed Harry to Chub, “we
shall be home long before supper-time.”</p>

<p>“Well, for my part,” answered Chub, turning
the spokes of the wheel idly back and forth, “I’m
about ready to eat some one else’s cooking. But
don’t whisper it to Dick.”</p>

<p>“This will be our last—I mean <em>my</em> last dinner
on board,” said Harry, regretfully. “Don’t you
think we might find a real pretty place to stop,
Chub?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, we can; and we’ll make a farewell
banquet of it and eat everything nice we’ve
got! You take the wheel a minute, and I’ll give
orders to my worthless crew.”</p>

<p>They made quite a ceremony of that dinner.
Dick, imbued with the spirit of the occasion, made
a jelly omelet as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce de résistance</i>, and piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
every good thing that the larder contained on the
table up under the striped awning. They had
stopped the headlong career of the <i>Slow Poke</i>
where a murmuring grove of trees came down and
leaned over the water as though to watch their
green finery mirrored back to them from the calm
surface. They had snubbed the boat’s bow close
to shore, so that half the upper deck was in the
cool shadow, and at that end they had placed the
table. Harry and Snip had jumped ashore and
brought back sprays of leaves for the adornment
of the festal board and Roy had ruthlessly snipped
a dozen big red blooms from the geraniums in
the boxes. Dinner was late, but no one minded,
not even the doctor, for Ferry Hill was less than
fifteen miles away, and three hours more would
bring them there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_410">The doctor was called on for a speech</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410-<br />411]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_409">The doctor was called on for a speech</a> when the
dessert was brought on, and responded eloquently,
finally toasting his hosts in a brimming glass of
“vin de Cold Spring.” Chub responded, “on
behalf of himself and his crew, who, being a
motley lot hailing from many countries, were unable
to speak the English.” The crew groaned
loudly at this, but later forgave the remark and
responded generously with applause. Snip ate
his repast from a dish at Harry’s side and had
a little of everything, as was only proper when you
consider the occasion. Harry decreed that no
one was to hurry the least little bit, and no one
did. And so it was two o’clock before the engine
began its work once more, and almost five when
the <i>Slow Poke</i> sidled up to the Ferry Hill landing,
and Snip, with a bark of sheer delight, leaped
the intervening two yards of water and capered
around the float.</p>

<p>I might tell, at the cost of many details and
much space, of the week that followed, but the
story is really finished at this moment. It was
a jolly week, the jolliest sort of a week, and every
one, even Dr. and Mrs. Emery, enjoyed it
thoroughly. And every one, Dr. and Mrs. Emery
not the least, regretted the arrival of the day
of departure. Good-bys were said, promises of
future meetings made, and, with the doctor and
Mrs. Emery and Harry waving from the landing,
and Snip barking farewell, the <i>Slow Poke</i> moved
away on the final stage of her journey. The boys
watched the group on the wharf until a point of
land hid it from view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nice folks those,” said Dick, quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, they are!” murmured Roy.</p>

<p>“Right, oh!” said Chub.</p>

<p>The voyage back to New York was taken in
easy stages, for, now that the end was in sight,
no one was really anxious to reach it. They
stopped when they liked, and started when it
pleased them, and had a pleasant, lazy time of it.
No incident of moment occurred worth setting
down here, unless, possibly, it is a very tiny incident
that happened on the second evening of the
homeward voyage. Chub was getting ready for
bed, and Roy and Dick were standing at his door
talking to him, their own disrobement complete.
Suddenly Dick pushed his way into the little
room and picked up something which was lying
face down on the bed beside Chub’s discarded
garments.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Dick. “Where’d you get the
photograph, Chub?”</p>

<p>“Here! You put that down!” exclaimed Chub,
making a dash for it. But Dick was too quick
for him and tossed it to Roy.</p>

<p>“Have a look!” he called, as Chub grappled
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>Roy had a look, and:</p>

<p>“It’s Harry!” he exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” asked Chub, defiantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” murmured Roy.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” echoed Dick, softly, and, joining
arms, they marched twice around the deck in
the moonlight, whistling Mendelssohn’s “Wedding
March” badly out of tune, and grinning like
a couple of Jack-o’-lanterns when they passed the
window. Chub, frowning and muttering, stowed
the photograph at the bottom of his suit-case.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
